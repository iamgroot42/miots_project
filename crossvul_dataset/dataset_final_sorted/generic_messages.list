"fixed zlib param parsing"
"Fix several mostly Windows related phpdbg bugs

* Properly initialize PHPDBG_G(watch_tmp)

  Otherwise that may cause segfaults in ZTS builds.

* Deactivate potentially remaining watchpoints after REPL

  Otherwise the memory could still be protected, resulting in segfaults
  during shutdown.

* NULL zend_handlers_table after freeing

  As of commit 4130fe4[1], the `zend_handlers_table` is explicitly
  freed in the `zend_vm_dtor()`.  Since phpdbg (and maybe some other
  SAPIs) may restart the engine afterwards, we have to make sure that
  the table is also NULLed.

* Only set context option if there is a context

  In other words, we must not follow the null pointer.

* Cater to file handles without attached console

  File handles do not necessarily have an attached console (for
  instance, pipes do not), in which case `GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo()`
  fails.  In this case we set a default value (`40`) for lines like on
  other systems.

"cifs: reinstate original behavior when uid=/gid= options are specified

This patch fixes the regression reported here:

http://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=13861

commit 4ae1507f6d266d0cc3dd36e474d83aad70fec9e4 changed the default
behavior when the uid= or gid= option was specified for a mount. The
existing behavior was to always clobber the ownership information
provided by the server when these options were specified. The above
commit changed this behavior so that these options simply provided
defaults when the server did not provide this information (unless
""forceuid"" or ""forcegid"" were specified)

This patch reverts this change so that the default behavior is restored.
It also adds ""noforceuid"" and ""noforcegid"" options to make it so that
ownership information from the server is preserved, even when the mount
has uid= or gid= options specified.

It also adds a couple of printk notices that pop up when forceuid or
forcegid options are specified without a uid= or gid= option.

"CMakeLists.txt: enable -fvisibility=hidden for internal symbols

Don't export internal symbols in the public symbol table.  This
reduces the number of exported symbols from 348 to 121.

The same is already being done on Windows by using
`__declspec(dllexport)`, and all functions not annotated with it will
be inaccessible by programs using JasPer.

Strangely, this refuses access to lots of functions in the public
headers.  I wonder why these were declared in the public headers.

To avoid breakages with programs using those internal symbols, this
feature is optional and must be enabled with the cmake option
`-DJAS_ENABLE_HIDDEN=true`."

USB: fixes for v5.7-rc5

Fixing raw-gadget's IOCTL return value. Enabling EXTCON for Intel
Merrifield. Couple leaks have been plugged in net2272 and
twl6030-usb. Returning an error code when things fail in cdc and ncm
legacy gadgets. An old bug on dwc3 regarding HWO bit handling has been
fixed.

Apart from these, some minor fixes.

"serial: pl011: handle corruption at high clock speeds

This works around a few glitches in the ST version of the PL011
serial driver when using very high baud rates, as we do in the
Ux500: 3, 3.25, 4 and 4.05 Mbps.

Problem Observed/rootcause:

When using high baud-rates, and the baudrate*8 is getting close to
the provided clock frequency (so a division factor close to 1), when
using bursts of characters (so they are abutted), then it seems as if
there is not enough time to detect the beginning of the start-bit which
is a timing reference for the entire character, and thus the sampling
moment of character bits is moving towards the end of each bit, instead
of the middle.

Fix:
Increase slightly the RX baud rate of the UART above the theoretical
baudrate by 5%. This will definitely give more margin time to the
UART_RX to correctly sample the data at the middle of the bit period.

Also fix the ages old copy-paste error in the very stressed comment,
it's referencing the registers used in the PL010 driver rather than
the PL011 ones.

"cgroup: css_release() shouldn't clear cgroup->subsys[]

c1a71504e971 (""cgroup: don't recycle cgroup id until all csses' have
been destroyed"") made cgroup ID persist until a cgroup is released and
add cgroup->subsys[] clearing to css_release() so that css_from_id()
doesn't return a css which has already been released which happens
before cgroup release; however, the right change here was updating
offline_css() to clear cgroup->subsys[] which was done by e32978031016
(""cgroup: cgroup->subsys[] should be cleared after the css is
offlined"") instead of clearing it from css_release().

We're now clearing cgroup->subsys[] twice.  This is okay for
traditional hierarchies as a css's lifetime is the same as its
cgroup's; however, this confuses unified hierarchy and turning on and
off a controller repeatedly using ""cgroup.subtree_control"" can lead to
an oops like the following which happens because cgroup->subsys[] is
incorrectly cleared asynchronously by css_release().

"Merge tag 'docs-for-linus' of git://git.lwn.net/linux

Pull documentation updates from Jonathan Corbet:
 ""Some big changes this month, headlined by the addition of a new
  formatted documentation mechanism based on the Sphinx system.

  The objectives here are to make it easier to create better-integrated
  (and more attractive) documents while (eventually) dumping our
  one-of-a-kind, cobbled-together system for something that is widely
  used and maintained by others.  There's a fair amount of information
  what's being done, why, and how to use it in:

    https://lwn.net/Articles/692704/
    https://lwn.net/Articles/692705/

  Closer to home, Documentation/kernel-documentation.rst describes how
  it works.

  For now, the new system exists alongside the old one; you should soon
  see the GPU documentation converted over in the DRM pull and some
  significant media conversion work as well.  Once all the docs have
  been moved over and we're convinced that the rough edges (of which are
  are a few) have been smoothed over, the DocBook-based stuff should go
  away.

  Primary credit is to Jani Nikula for doing the heavy lifting to make
  this stuff actually work; there has also been notable effort from
  Markus Heiser, Daniel Vetter, and Mauro Carvalho Chehab.

  Expect a couple of conflicts on the new index.rst file over the course
  of the merge window; they are trivially resolvable.  That file may be
  a bit of a conflict magnet in the short term, but I don't expect that
  situation to last for any real length of time.

  Beyond that, of course, we have the usual collection of tweaks,
  updates, and typo fixes""

"PCI: pciehp: Disable/enable link during slot power off/on

On a system with a repeater on the system board to support gen2 hotplug,
we found that when an ExpressModule is removed from some slots,
/var/log/messages will be full of ""card present/not present"" warnings.

It turns out the root complex is continually trying to train the link to
the repeater because the repeater has not been reset.

This patch will disable the link at removal time to allow the repeater
to be reset properly.  This also prevents a potential AER message at
removal time.

Also, when testing hotplug on a system under development, we found if we
boot the system without an EM installed, and later hot-add an EM, it
does not work with Linux, but another OS is ok.  The root cause is that
BIOS left link disabled when slot was empty at boot time, and other OS
is modifying the link disable bit in link ctrl during power on/off.

So we should do the same thing to disable/enable link during power off/on.

-v2: check link DLLA bit instead of 100ms waiting.
     Separate link disable/enable functions to another patch.

"ipv6: sr: expand skb head only if necessary

To insert or encapsulate a packet with an SRH, we need a large enough skb
headroom. Currently, we are using pskb_expand_head to inconditionally increase
the size of the headroom by the amount needed by the SRH (and IPv6 header).
If this reallocation is performed by another CPU than the one that initially
allocated the skb, then when the initial CPU kfree the skb, it will enter the
__slab_free slowpath, impacting performances.

This patch replaces pskb_expand_head with skb_cow_head, that will reallocate the
skb head only if the headroom is not large enough.

"fs/block_dev.c: page cache wrongly left invalidated after revalidate_disk()

We found that bdev->bd_invalidated was left set once revalidate_disk()
is called, which results in page cache flush every time that device is
open.

Specifically, we found this problem in MD block device.  Once we resize
a MD device, mdadm --monitor periodically flush all page cache for that
device every 60 or 1000 seconds when it opens the device.

This bug lies since at least 3.2.0 till the latest kernel(3.6.2).  Patch
is attached.

The following steps will reproduce the problem.

1. prepair a block device (eg /dev/sdb).

2. create two partitions:

   sudo parted /dev/sdb
   mklabel gpt
   mkpart primary 0% 50%
   mkpart primary 50% 100%

3. create a md device.

   sudo mdadm -C /dev/md/hoge -l 1 -n 2 -e 1.2 --assume-clean --auto=md --symlink=no /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdb2

4. create file system and mount it

   sudo mkfs.ext3 /dev/md/hoge
   sudo mkdir /mnt/test
   sudo mount /dev/md/hoge /mnt/test

5. try to resize the device

   sudo mdadm -G /dev/md/hoge --size=max

6. create a file to fill file cache.

  sudo dd if=/dev/urandom of=/mnt/test/data bs=1M count=10

and verify the current status of file by free command.

7. mdadm monitor will open the md device every 1000 seconds and you
   will find all file cache on the device are cleared.

The timing can be reduced by the following steps.

a) kill mdadm and restart it with --delay option

   /sbin/mdadm --monitor --delay=30 --pid-file /var/run/mdadm/monitor.pid --daemonise --scan --syslog

or open the md device directly.

   sudo dd if=/dev/md/hoge of=/dev/null bs=4096 count=1

"mm: kmemleak: use the memory pool for early allocations

Currently kmemleak uses a static early_log buffer to trace all memory
allocation/freeing before the slab allocator is initialised.  Such early
log is replayed during kmemleak_init() to properly initialise the kmemleak
metadata for objects allocated up that point.  With a memory pool that
does not rely on the slab allocator, it is possible to skip this early log
entirely.

In order to remove the early logging, consider kmemleak_enabled == 1 by
default while the kmem_cache availability is checked directly on the
object_cache and scan_area_cache variables.  The RCU callback is only
invoked after object_cache has been initialised as we wouldn't have any
concurrent list traversal before this.

In order to reduce the number of callbacks before kmemleak is fully
initialised, move the kmemleak_init() call to mm_init().

"Allow 'lport 0' setup for random port binding

I am running a multihomed host where 'local <extip>' must be specified
for proper operation.  Unfortunately, this implies 'lport 1194' or
another static port.

This causes problems with stateful firewalls which register the host/port
pairs in the internal connection tracking table. On ungraceful reconnects,
the new TCP connection will have same the host/port pairs but unexpected
sequence numbers. The new connection will be assumed as invalid hence and
be dropped.

It would be nice when local port can be configured to be bound to a
random port number.  After reading code,

|    else if (streq (p[0], ""lport"") && p[1])
|  ...
|        port = atoi (p[1]);

"regulator: core: Only count load for enabled consumers

In general when the consumer of a regulator requests that the
regulator be disabled it no longer will be drawing much load from the
regulator--it should just be the leakage current and that should be
very close to 0.

Up to this point the regulator framework has continued to count a
consumer's load request for disabled regulators.  This has led to code
patterns that look like this:

  enable_my_thing():
    regular_set_load(reg, load_uA)
    regulator_enable(reg)

  disable_my_thing():
    regulator_disable(reg)
    regulator_set_load(reg, 0)

Sometimes disable_my_thing() sets a nominal (<= 100 uA) load instead
of setting a 0 uA load.  I will make the assertion that nearly all (if
not all) places where we set a nominal load of 100 uA or less we end
up with a result that is the same as if we had set a load of 0 uA.
Specifically:
- The whole point of setting the load is to help set the operating

- The only time this matters at all is if there is another consumer of
  the regulator that wants the regulator on.  If there are no other
  consumers of the regulator then the regulator will turn off and we
  don't care about the operating mode.
- If there's another consumer that actually wants the regulator on

Before moving tasks out of empty cpusets, update_tasks_nodemask()
is called, which calls do_migrate_pages(xx, from, to). Then those
tasks are moved to an ancestor, and do_migrate_pages() is called
again.

The first time: from = node_to_be_offlined, to = empty.
The second time: from = empty, to = ancestor's nodemask.

so looks like no pages will be migrated.

Fix this by:

- Don't call update_tasks_nodemask() on empty cpusets.
- Pass cs->old_mems_allowed to do_migrate_pages().

"mmc: mmc: Improve reliability of mmc_select_hs200()

Currently mmc_select_hs200() uses __mmc_switch() which checks the
success of the switch to HS200 mode using CMD13 (SEND_STATUS).
The problem is that it does that using the timing settings of legacy
mode.  That is prone to error, not least because the timing parameters
for legacy mode are tighter than the timing parameters for HS200 mode.

In the case when CMD13 polling is used (i.e. not MMC_CAP_WAIT_WHILE_BUSY)
with the switch command, it must be assumed that using different modes on
the card and host must work.

However in the case when CMD13 polling is not used
(i.e. MMC_CAP_WAIT_WHILE_BUSY) mmc_select_hs200() can be made more
reliable by setting the host to the correct timing before sending CMD13.

This patch does that.

A complication is that the caller, mmc_select_timing(), will ignore a
switch error (indicated by -EBADMSG), assume the old mode is valid
and continue, so the old timing must be restored in that case.

  Namespaces support (NAMESPACES) [Y/?] (NEW) y

  Enable the block layer (BLOCK) [Y/?] (NEW) y
  ...

You can also notice this bug when using gconfig/xconfig.

It's because the SYMBOL_DEF_USER bit of an invisible symbol is cleared
when the config file is read:

int conf_read(const char *name)

	...
	for_all_symbols(i, sym) {
		if (sym_has_value(sym) && !sym_is_choice_value(sym)) {

			 * configuration disagree.
			 */
			if (sym->visible == no && !conf_unsaved)
				sym->flags &= ~SYMBOL_DEF_USER;

}

But a menu item which represents an invisible symbol is still
visible, if it's sub-menu is visible, so its SYMBOL_DEF_USER
bit should be set to indicate it's not NEW.

in the transaction, and without having a minleft check on the current
AG, leading to the assert firing on a very full and heavily used

higher AGs for now we can simply the check to always allow for equal

"thermal: int340x: processor_thermal: Add RFIM driver

Add support for RFIM (Radio Frequency Interference Mitigation) support
via processor thermal PCI device. This drivers allows adjustment of
FIVR (Fully Integrated Voltage Regulator) and DDR (Double Data Rate)
frequencies to avoid RF interference with WiFi and 5G.

Switching voltage regulators (VR) generate radiated EMI or RFI at the
fundamental frequency and its harmonics. Some harmonics may interfere
with very sensitive wireless receivers such as Wi-Fi and cellular that
are integrated into host systems like notebook PCs.  One of mitigation
methods is requesting SOC integrated VR (IVR) switching frequency to a
small % and shift away the switching noise harmonic interference from
radio channels.  OEM or ODMs can use the driver to control SOC IVR
operation within the range where it does not impact IVR performance.

DRAM devices of DDR IO interface and their power plane can generate EMI
at the data rates. Similar to IVR control mechanism, Intel offers a
mechanism by which DDR data rates can be changed if several conditions
are met: there is strong RFI interference because of DDR; CPU power
management has no other restriction in changing DDR data rates;
PC ODMs enable this feature (real time DDR RFI Mitigation referred to as
DDR-RFIM) for Wi-Fi from BIOS.

This change exports two folders under /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:00:04.0.
One folder ""fivr"" contains all attributes exposed for controling FIVR
features. The other folder ""dvfs"" contains all attributes for DDR
features.

Changes done to implement:
- New module for rfim interfaces
- Two new per processor features for DDR and FIVR
- Enable feature for Tiger Lake (FIVR only) and Alder Lake

The attributes exposed and explanation:

FIVR attributes

vco_ref_code_lo (RW): The VCO reference code is an 11-bit field and
controls the FIVR switching frequency. This is the 3-bit LSB field.

vco_ref_code_hi (RW): The VCO reference code is an 11-bit field and
controls the FIVR switching frequency. This is the 8-bit MSB field.

spread_spectrum_pct (RW): Set the FIVR spread spectrum clocking
percentage

spread_spectrum_clk_enable (RW): Enable/disable of the FIVR spread
spectrum clocking feature

rfi_vco_ref_code (RW): This field is a read only status register which
reflects the current FIVR switching frequency

fivr_fffc_rev (RW): This field indicated the revision of the FIVR HW.

DVFS attributes

rfi_restriction_run_busy (RW): Request the restriction of specific DDR
data rate and set this value 1. Self reset to 0 after operation.

rfi_restriction_err_code (RW): Values:  0 :Request is accepted, 1:Feature
disabled, 2: the request restricts more points than it is allowed

rfi_restriction_data_rate_Delta (RW): Restricted DDR data rate for RFI
protection: Lower Limit

rfi_restriction_data_rate_Base (RW): Restricted DDR data rate for RFI
protection: Upper Limit

ddr_data_rate_point_0 (RO): DDR data rate selection 1st point

ddr_data_rate_point_1 (RO): DDR data rate selection 2nd point

ddr_data_rate_point_2 (RO): DDR data rate selection 3rd point

"HWPOISON: return early on non-LRU pages

Right now we have some trouble with non atomic access
to page flags when locking the page. To plug this hole
for now, limit error recovery to LRU pages for now.

This could be better fixed by defining a suitable protocol,
but let's go this simple way for now

This avoids unnecessary races with __set_page_locked() and
__SetPageSlab*() and maybe more non-atomic page flag operations.

This loses isolated pages which are currently in page reclaim, but these
are relatively limited compared to the total memory.

"TTY: n_tty, do not dereference user buffer

copy_from_read_buf currently copies data to a user buffer and then
checks if the data is single EOF. But it checks it by accessing the
user buffer. First, the buffer may be changed by other threads of the
user program already. Second, it accesses the buffer without any
checks. It might be write-only for example.

Fix this by inspecting contents of the tty (kernel) buffer instead.
Note that ""n == 1"" is necessary, but not sufficient. But we check
later that there is nothing left by ""!tty->read_cnt"" condition.

There is still an issue with the current code that EOF being wrapped
to the start of the circular buffer will result in an inappropriate
losing of the EOF character. But this is not intended to be fixed by
this patch.

"cpuidle: menu: Handle stopped tick more aggressively

Commit 87c9fe6ee495 (cpuidle: menu: Avoid selecting shallow states
with stopped tick) missed the case when the target residencies of
deep idle states of CPUs are above the tick boundary which may cause
the CPU to get stuck in a shallow idle state for a long time.

Say there are two CPU idle states available: one shallow, with the
target residency much below the tick boundary and one deep, with
the target residency significantly above the tick boundary.  In
that case, if the tick has been stopped already and the expected
next timer event is relatively far in the future, the governor will
assume the idle duration to be equal to TICK_USEC and it will select
the idle state for the CPU accordingly.  However, that will cause the
shallow state to be selected even though it would have been more
energy-efficient to select the deep one.

To address this issue, modify the governor to always use the time
till the closest timer event instead of the predicted idle duration
if the latter is less than the tick period length and the tick has
been stopped already.  Also make it extend the search for a matching
idle state if the tick is stopped to avoid settling on a shallow
state if deep states with target residencies above the tick period
length are available.

In addition, make it always indicate that the tick should be stopped
if it has been stopped already for consistency.

"xprtrdma: Remove FMRs from the unmap list after unmapping

ib_unmap_fmr() takes a list of FMRs to unmap. However, it does not
remove the FMRs from this list as it processes them. Other
ib_unmap_fmr() call sites are careful to remove FMRs from the list
after ib_unmap_fmr() returns.

Since commit 7c7a5390dc6c8 (""xprtrdma: Add ro_unmap_sync method for FMR"")
fmr_op_unmap_sync passes more than one FMR to ib_unmap_fmr(), but
it didn't bother to remove the FMRs from that list once the call was
complete.

I've noticed some instability that could be related to list
tangling by the new fmr_op_unmap_sync() logic. In an abundance
of caution, add some defensive logic to clean up properly after
ib_unmap_fmr().

"x86: geode: New PCEngines Alix system driver

This new driver replaces the old PCEngines Alix 2/3 LED driver with a
new driver that controls the LEDs through the leds-gpio driver. The
old driver accessed GPIOs directly, which created a conflict and
prevented also loading the cs5535-gpio driver to read other GPIOs on
the Alix board. With this new driver, we hook into leds-gpio which in
turn uses GPIO to control the LEDs and therefore it's possible to
control both the LEDs and access onboard GPIOs

Driver is moved to platform/geode as requested by Grant and any other
geode initialisation modules should move here also

This driver is inspired by leds-net5501.c by Alessandro Zummo.

Ideally, leds-net5501.c should also be moved to platform/geode. 
Additionally the driver relies on parts of the patch: 7f131cf3ed (""leds:
leds-alix2c - take port address from MSR) by Daniel Mack to perform
detection of the Alix board.

"KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Don't dynamically split core when already split

In static micro-threading modes, the dynamic micro-threading code
is supposed to be disabled, because subcores can't make independent
decisions about what micro-threading mode to put the core in - there is
only one micro-threading mode for the whole core.  The code that
implements dynamic micro-threading checks for this, except that the
check was missed in one case.  This means that it is possible for a
subcore in static 2-way micro-threading mode to try to put the core
into 4-way micro-threading mode, which usually leads to stuck CPUs,
spinlock lockups, and other stalls in the host.

The problem was in the can_split_piggybacked_subcores() function, which
should always return false if the system is in a static micro-threading
mode.  This fixes the problem by making can_split_piggybacked_subcores()
use subcore_config_ok() for its checks, as subcore_config_ok() includes
the necessary check for the static micro-threading modes.

Credit to Gautham Shenoy for working out that the reason for the hangs
and stalls we were seeing was that we were trying to do dynamic 4-way
micro-threading while we were in static 2-way mode.

"Merge branch 'ipvlan-packet-scrub'

Mahesh Bandewar says:

====================
ipvlan: packet scrub

While crossing namespace boundary IPvlan aggressively scrubs packets.
This is creating problems. First thing is that scrubbing changes the
packet type in skb meta-data to PACKET_HOST. This causes erroneous
packet delivery when dev_forward_skb() has already marked the packet
type as OTHER_HOST.

On the egress side scrubbing just before calling dev_queue_xmit()
creates another set of problems. Scrubbing remove skb->sk so the
prio update gets missed and more seriously, socket back-pressure
fails making TSQ not function correctly.

The first patch in the series just reverts the earlier change which
was adding a mac-check, but that is unnecessary if packet_type that
dev_forward_skb() has set is honored. The second path removes two of
the scrubs which are causing problems described above.

"net: bridge: convert multicast to generic rhashtable

The bridge multicast code currently uses a custom resizable hashtable
which predates the generic rhashtable interface. It has many
shortcomings compared and duplicates functionality that is presently
available via the generic rhashtable, so this patch removes the custom
rhashtable implementation in favor of the kernel's generic rhashtable.
The hash maximum is kept and the rhashtable's size is used to do a loose
check if it's reached in which case we revert to the old behaviour and
disable further bridge multicast processing. Also now we can support any
hash maximum, doesn't need to be a power of 2.

v3: add non-rcu br_mdb_get variant and use it where multicast_lock is

"ACPI / PM: Take unusual configurations of power resources into account

Commit d2e5f0c (ACPI / PCI: Rework the setup and cleanup of device
wakeup) moved the initial disabling of system wakeup for PCI devices
into a place where it can actually work and that exposed a hidden old
issue with crap^Wunusual system designs where the same power
resources are used for both wakeup power and device power control at
run time.

Namely, say there is one power resource such that the ACPI power
state D0 of a PCI device depends on that power resource (i.e. the
device is in D0 when that power resource is ""on"") and it is used
as a wakeup power resource for the same device.  Then, calling
acpi_pci_sleep_wake(pci_dev, false) for the device in question will
cause the reference counter of that power resource to drop to 0,
which in turn will cause it to be turned off.  As a result, the
device will go into D3cold at that point, although it should have
stayed in D0.

As it turns out, that happens to USB controllers on some laptops
and USB becomes unusable on those machines as a result, which is
a major regression from v3.8.

To fix this problem, (1) increment the reference counters of wakup
power resources during their initialization if they are ""on""
initially, (2) prevent acpi_disable_wakeup_device_power() from
decrementing the reference counters of wakeup power resources that
were not enabled for wakeup power previously, and (3) prevent
acpi_enable_wakeup_device_power() from incrementing the reference
counters of wakeup power resources that already are enabled for
wakeup power.

In addition to that, if it is impossible to determine the initial
states of wakeup power resources, avoid enabling wakeup for devices
whose wakeup power depends on those power resources.

"binfmt_misc: add comments & debug logs

When trying to develop a custom format handler, the errors returned all
effectively get bucketed as EINVAL with no kernel messages.  The other
errors (ENOMEM/EFAULT) are internal/obvious and basic.  Thus any time a
bad handler is rejected, the developer has to walk the dense code and
try to guess where it went wrong.  Needing to dive into kernel code is
itself a fairly high barrier for a lot of people.

To improve this situation, let's deploy extensive pr_debug markers at
logical parse points, and add comments to the dense parsing logic.  It
let's you see exactly where the parsing aborts, the string the kernel
received (useful when dealing with shell code), how it translated the
buffers to binary data, and how it will apply the mask at runtime.

Some example output:
  $ echo ':qemu-foo:M::\x7fELF\xAD\xAD\x01\x00:\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\x00\xff\x00:/usr/bin/qemu-foo:POC' > register

3e38023af724a76972d39cbccfb0bba4c54a0323 scripts: add PE .reloc section check to security-check.py (fanquake)

Pull request description:

  The `ld` in binutils has historically had a few issues with PE binaries, there's a good summary in this [thread](https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=19011).

  One issue in particular was `ld` stripping the `.reloc` section out of PE binaries, even though it's required for functioning ASLR. This was [reported by a Tor developer in 2014](https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=17321) and they have been patching their [own binutils](https://gitweb.torproject.org/builders/tor-browser-build.git/tree/projects/binutils) ever since. However their patch only made it into binutils at the [start of this year](https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=binutils-gdb.git;a=commit;h=dc9bd8c92af67947db44b3cb428c050259b15cd0). It adds an `--enable-reloc-section` flag, which is turned on by default if you are using `--dynamic-base`. In the mean time this issue has also been worked around by other projects, such as FFmpeg, see [this commit](https://github.com/TheRyuu/FFmpeg/commit/91b668acd6decec0a6f8d20bf56e2644f96adcb9).

  I have checked our recent supported Windows release binaries, and they do contain a `.reloc` section. From what I understand, we are using all the right compile/linker flags, including `-pie` & `-fPIE`, and have never run into the crashing/entrypoint issues that other projects might have seen.

  One other thing worth noting here, it how Debian/Ubuntu patch the binutils that they distribute, because that's what we end up using in our gitian builds.

  In the binutils-mingw-w64 in Bionic (18.04), which we currently use in gitian, PE hardening options/security flags are enabled by default. See the [changelog](https://changelogs.ubuntu.com/changelogs/pool/universe/b/binutils-mingw-w64/binutils-mingw-w64_8ubuntu1/changelog) and the [relevant commit](https://salsa.debian.org/mingw-w64-team/binutils-mingw-w64/-/commit/452b3013b8280cbe35eaeb166a43621b88d5f8b7).

  However in Focal (20.04), this has now been reversed. PE hardening options are no-longer the default. See the [changelog](https://changelogs.ubuntu.com/changelogs/pool/universe/b/binutils-mingw-w64/binutils-mingw-w64_8.8/changelog) and [relevant commit](https://salsa.debian.org/mingw-w64-team/binutils-mingw-w64/-/commit/7bd8b2fbc242a8c2fc2217f29fd61f94d3babf6f), which cites same .reloc issue mentioned here.

  Given that we explicitly specify/opt-in to everything that we want to use, the defaults aren't necessarily an issue for us. However I think it highlights the importance of continuing to be explicit about what we want, and not falling-back or relying on upstream.

  This was also prompted by the possibility of us doing link time garbage collection, see #18579 & #18605. It seemed some sanity checks would be worthwhile in-case the linker goes haywire while garbage collecting.

  I think Guix is going to bring great benefits when dealing with these kinds of issues. Carl you might have something to say in that regard.

"Minscript POC

Summary:
Minscript, or `mins` for short, is a minimalistic bytecode interpreter
for scripting. This is the 3rd proof of concept version and also the
simplest. Previous versions experimented with other approaches and more
complexity.

The bytecode is stack based and is designed to support the following
features:
- lexical closures
- classes with static keys and inheritance
- arrays with integer keys
- dicts with dynamic keys
- strings, floating point numbers, bools, undefined
- the usual control flow constructs
- exceptions with try/catch/finally

The interpreter itself is intended to support:
- optional garbage collection (+1KB binary size)
- bump pointer allocation from a pre-existing buffer
- very fast startup
- ffi

At this time enough has been implemented in order to run the
""interpreter-dispatch"" benchmark, which calculates factorial in a loop.

The performance in that benchmark in the POC is about 3x slower than
Hermes. The size of a standalone Android ARM32 executable is 17K, of
which 10KB is actual code, so the expected impact when linked in an
existing binary is about that.

It builds in the Hermes directory for convenience, but the intent is for
the runtime to have no dependencies on Hermes or LLVM (the latter is too
much hassle for a minimalistic interpreter).

"async zvol minor node creation interferes with receive

When we finish a zfs receive, dmu_recv_end_sync() calls
zvol_create_minors(async=TRUE).  This kicks off some other threads that
create the minor device nodes (in /dev/zvol/poolname/...).  These async
threads call zvol_prefetch_minors_impl() and zvol_create_minor(), which
both call dmu_objset_own(), which puts a ""long hold"" on the dataset.
Since the zvol minor node creation is asynchronous, this can happen
after the `ZFS_IOC_RECV[_NEW]` ioctl and `zfs receive` process have
completed.

After the first receive ioctl has completed, userland may attempt to do
another receive into the same dataset (e.g. the next incremental
stream).  This second receive and the asynchronous minor node creation
can interfere with one another in several different ways, because they
both require exclusive access to the dataset:

1. When the second receive is finishing up, dmu_recv_end_check() does
dsl_dataset_handoff_check(), which can fail with EBUSY if the async
minor node creation already has a ""long hold"" on this dataset.  This
causes the 2nd receive to fail.

2. The async udev rule can fail if zvol_id and/or systemd-udevd try to
open the device while the the second receive's async attempt at minor
node creation owns the dataset (via zvol_prefetch_minors_impl).  This
causes the minor node (/dev/zd*) to exist, but the udev-generated
/dev/zvol/... to not exist.

3. The async minor node creation can silently fail with EBUSY if the
first receive's zvol_create_minor() trys to own the dataset while the
second receive's zvol_prefetch_minors_impl already owns the dataset.

To address these problems, this change synchronously creates the minor
node.  To avoid the lock ordering problems that the asynchrony was
introduced to fix (see #3681), we create the minor nodes from open
context, with no locks held, rather than from syncing contex as was
originally done.

Implementation notes:

We generally do not need to traverse children or prefetch anything (e.g.
when running the recv, snapshot, create, or clone subcommands of zfs).
We only need recursion when importing/opening a pool and when loading
encryption keys.  The existing recursive, asynchronous, prefetching code
is preserved for use in these cases.

Channel programs may need to create zvol minor nodes, when creating a
snapshot of a zvol with the snapdev property set.  We figure out what
snapshots are created when running the LUA program in syncing context.
In this case we need to remember what snapshots were created, and then
try to create their minor nodes from open context, after the LUA code
has completed.

There are additional zvol use cases that asynchronously own the dataset,
which can cause similar problems.  E.g. changing the volmode or snapdev
properties.  These are less problematic because they are not recursive
and don't touch datasets that are not involved in the operation, there
is still potential for interference with subsequent operations.  In the
future, these cases should be similarly converted to create the zvol
minor node synchronously from open context.

The async tasks of removing and renaming minors do not own the objset,
so they do not have this problem.  However, it may make sense to also
convert these operations to happen synchronously from open context, in
the future.

"[SMS App] Make sms app not crash when conversation is selected with no devices connected

Summary: This patch fixes T10184 and stops the SMS app from crashing when a conversation is selected but no devices are connected. It also allows the SMS app to access the cached messages in the ConversationsDbusInterface so the app is still slightly useful even when the device is disconnected.

Test Plan:
- Open sms app
- Open a few conversations
- Disconnect phone (Force close app?)
- Re-open a conversation which was previously opened
  - Verify that the messages appear. It is possible to scroll up to view any older cached messages too!
- Open a conversation which was not opened previously
  - Verify that a single messages is shown (since this was the only one in cache, from populating the list of all conversations)
  - Verify that attempting to scroll this conversation does nothing, but also does not crash the app

Note: Opening the app with no phone connected will cause it to lose its handle on the deviceId, so it can't spawn a new Dbus interface, so it will remain blank and empty. Solving that is a project for another day.

"MIPS: Retrieve ASID masks using function accepting struct cpuinfo_mips

In preparation for supporting variable ASID masks, retrieve ASID masks
using functions in asm/cpu-info.h which accept struct cpuinfo_mips. This
will allow those functions to determine the ASID mask based upon the CPU
in a later patch. This also allows for the r3k & r8k cases to be handled
in Kconfig, which is arguably cleaner than the previous #ifdefs.

"plug fountain & throne SIGHUP cheat

     When using a fountain or throne, getting a --More-- prompt
usually means that you're about to be told that it has just dried
up or vanished.  But since that topology change didn't occur until
after the message, players could cheat by forcing SIGHUP instead
of answering the prompt; the resulting save file would retain the
original topology.  So change the dungeon prior to telling the user
about it.

     The `fixes' entry possibly belongs in the tty-specific category
but since the change is to core code I put it in the general section."
"^I vs perm_invent again

A recent fix for #wizidentify showing ""Not carrying anything"" after
listing inventory items still showed ""Not carrying anything"" after
""(all items are already identified)"".  Fix is easy.

Trickier bug was that ^I performs object ID on selected items while
the inventory routine is still in progress (but after it has processed
every item) and the ID routine will call update_inventory() which
will call the inventory routine to reformat invent.  So the inventory
display routine was called recursively without having returned to
wizidentify where iflags.override_ID gets cleared to revert to normal
inventory.  The nested call was unintentionally narrowing the contents
of persistent inventory window to whatever items were still unIDed.
(Any inventory update, including ^R, restored it to full inventory.)"

"pb_istream_from_buffer: add const to prototype

This commit changes the prototype for pb_istream_from_buffer from:
  pb_istream_t pb_istream_from_buffer(uint8_t *buf, size_t bufsize);
to
  pb_istream_t pb_istream_from_buffer(const uint8_t *buf, size_t bufsize);

This allows pb_istream_from_buffer users to point to const buffers
without having to inspect code (to ensure practical const-ness) and then be
forced to manually cast away const.

In order to not break compatibility with existing programs (by
introducing a const/non-const union in the pb_istream_t state) we simply
cast away the const in pb_istream_from_buffer and re-apply it when
possible in the callbacks.  Unfortunately we lose any compiler help in
the callbacks to ensure we are treating the buffer as const but manual
inspection is easy enough."

"video: fbdev: aty: use arch_phys_wc_add() and ioremap_wc()

Convert the driver from using the x86 specific MTRR code to
the architecture agnostic arch_phys_wc_add(). arch_phys_wc_add()
will avoid MTRR if write-combining is available, in order to
take advantage of that also ensure the ioremap'd area is requested
as write-combining.

There are a few motivations for this:

a) Take advantage of PAT when available

b) Help bury MTRR code away, MTRR is architecture specific and on
   x86 its replaced by PAT

c) Help with the goal of eventually using _PAGE_CACHE_UC over
   _PAGE_CACHE_UC_MINUS on x86 on ioremap_nocache() (see commit
   de33c442e titled ""x86 PAT: fix performance drop for glx,
   use UC minus for ioremap(), ioremap_nocache() and
   pci_mmap_page_range()"")

The conversion done is expressed by the following Coccinelle
SmPL patch, it additionally required manual intervention to
address all the #ifdery and removal of redundant things which
arch_phys_wc_add() already addresses such as verbose message
about when MTRR fails and doing nothing when we didn't get
an MTRR.

"UBI: add lnum and vol_id to struct ubi_work

This is part of a multipart patch to allow UBI to force the erasure of
particular logical eraseblock numbers. In this patch, the volume id and LEB
number are added to ubi_work data structure, and both are also passed as a
parameter to schedule erase to set it appropriately. Whenever ubi_wl_put_peb
is called, the lnum is also passed to be forwarded to schedule erase. Later,
a new ubi_sync_lnum will be added to execute immediately all work related to
that lnum.

This was tested by outputting the vol_id and lnum during the schedule of
erasure. The ubi thread was disabled and two ubifs drives on separate
partitions repeated changed a small number of LEBs. The ubi module was readded,
and all the erased LEBs, corresponding to the volumes, were added to the
schedule erase queue.

pl180 integrations. MCIFIFOCNT register contains the number of
words that are still waiting to be transferred through the FIFO. It keeps
decrementing once the host CPU reads the MCIFIFO. With the existing logic and
the MCIFIFOCNT behaviour, mmci_pio_read will loop forever, as the FIFOCNT
register will always return transfer size before reading the FIFO.

Also the data sheet states that ""This register is only useful for debug
purposes and should not be used for normal operation since it does not reflect
data which may or may not be in the pipeline"".

This patch implements a qcom specific get_rx_fifocnt function which is
implemented based on status register flags. Based on qcom_fifo flag in
variant data structure, the corresponding get_rx_fifocnt function is selected.

"Use Typing_defs.ty_compare for ambiguous member lookup

Summary: When a generic has multiple upper bound constraints we emit an error if each of the upper bounds contains a member unless they all compare structurally equal. The structural equality used is the polymorphic equality which will include reason information. By switching to using `Typing_defs.ty_equal` we can ignore the reason information and disambiguate more cases.

"avoid re-lowering operand for silent operator

Summary:
If codegen is false, there is no node dedicated for silent operator and child node is promoted. Also child node's pos is set by current pos, therefore `Some(pos)` is passed to `p_expr_impl`. The previous implementation calls `p_expr_impl` on `operand` again, however `p_expr_impl` isn't idempotent, await expression will be collected twice.

To fix it, call `p_expr_impl` with correct `pos` at the first time.

"aio: fix uncorrent dirty pages accouting when truncating AIO ring buffer

https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=86831

Markus reported that when shutting down mysqld (with AIO support,
on a ext3 formatted Harddrive) leads to a negative number of dirty pages
(underrun to the counter). The negative number results in a drastic reduction
of the write performance because the page cache is not used, because the kernel
thinks it is still 2 ^ 32 dirty pages open.

Add a warn trace in __dec_zone_state will catch this easily:

static inline void __dec_zone_state(struct zone *zone, enum
	zone_stat_item item)
{
     atomic_long_dec(&zone->vm_stat[item]);
+    WARN_ON_ONCE(item == NR_FILE_DIRTY &&
	atomic_long_read(&zone->vm_stat[item]) < 0);
     atomic_long_dec(&vm_stat[item]);
}

The cause is that we set the aio ring file pages as *DIRTY* via SetPageDirty
(bypasses the VFS dirty pages increment) when init, and aio fs uses
*default_backing_dev_info* as the backing dev, which does not disable
the dirty pages accounting capability.
So truncating aio ring file will contribute to accounting dirty pages (VFS
dirty pages decrement), then error occurs.

The original goal is keeping these pages in memory (can not be reclaimed
or swapped) in life-time via marking it dirty. But thinking more, we have
already pinned pages via elevating the page's refcount, which can already
achieve the goal, so the SetPageDirty seems unnecessary.

In order to fix the issue, using the __set_page_dirty_no_writeback instead
of the nop .set_page_dirty, and dropped the SetPageDirty (don't manually
set the dirty flags, don't disable set_page_dirty(), rely on default behaviour).

With the above change, the dirty pages accounting can work well. But as we
known, aio fs is an anonymous one, which should never cause any real write-back,
we can ignore the dirty pages (write back) accounting by disabling the dirty
pages (write back) accounting capability. So we introduce an aio private
backing dev info (disabled the ACCT_DIRTY/WRITEBACK/ACCT_WB capabilities) to
replace the default one.

This driver module now only supports a single board type, so remove the

comedi device's `board_name` or `board_ptr` members.  The former is
automatically pointed to the comedi driver's `driver_name` by the core
comedi module, and the latter is not used anywhere else.  The AO
subdevice's `n_chans` member can be set to 16 without looking it up in
the single element of `pci6208_boards[]`.  There is no need to pass a
board index from the PCI device table to the ""auto_attach"" handler.

"dm: optimize dm_mq_queue_rq()

DM multipath is the only dm-mq target.  But that aside, request-based DM
only supports tables with a single target that is immutable.  Leverage
this fact in dm_mq_queue_rq() by using the 'immutable_target' stored in
the mapped_device when the table was made active.  This saves the need
to even take the read-side of the SRCU via dm_{get,put}_live_table.

If the active DM table does not have an immutable target (e.g. ""error""
target was swapped in) then fallback to the slow-path where the target
is looked up from the live table.

"cpufreq: intel_pstate: Fix intel_pstate powersave min_perf_pct value

On systems that initialize the intel_pstate driver with the performance
governor, and then switch to the powersave governor will not transition to
lower cpu frequencies until /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/min_perf_pct
is set to a low value.

The behavior of governor switching changed after commit a04759924e25
(""[cpufreq] intel_pstate: honor user space min_perf_pct override on
 resume"").  The commit introduced tracking of performance percentage
changes via sysfs in order to restore userspace changes during
suspend/resume.  The problem occurs because the global values of the newly
introduced max_sysfs_pct and min_sysfs_pct are not lowered on the governor
change and this causes the powersave governor to inherit the performance
governor's settings.

A simple change would have been to reset max_sysfs_pct to 100 and
min_sysfs_pct to 0 on a governor change, which fixes the problem with
governor switching.  However, since we cannot break userspace[1] the fix
is now to give each governor its own limits storage area so that governor
specific changes are tracked.

I successfully tested this by booting with both the performance governor
and the powersave governor by default, and switching between the two
governors (while monitoring /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/ values,
and looking at the output of cpupower frequency-info).  Suspend/Resume
testing was performed by Doug Smythies.

[1] Systems which suspend/resume using the unmaintained pm-utils package
will always transition to the performance governor before the suspend and
after the resume.  This means a system using the powersave governor will
go from powersave to performance, then suspend/resume, performance to
powersave.  The simple change during governor changes would have been
overwritten when the governor changed before and after the suspend/resume.
I have submitted https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1271225
against Fedora to remove the 94cpufreq file that causes the problem.  It
should be noted that pm-utils is obsoleted with newer versions of systemd.

"scripts/decodecode: set ARCH when running natively on arm/arm64

When running decodecode natively on arm64, ARCH is likely not to be set,
and we end-up with .4byte instead of .inst when generating the
disassembly.

Similar effects would occur if running natively on a 32bit ARM platform,
although that's even less popular.

A simple workaround is to populate ARCH when it is not set and that we're
running on an arm/arm64 system.

"i40e: fix handling of HW ATR eviction

A recent commit to refactor the driver and remove the hw_disabled_flags
field accidentally introduced two regressions. First, we overwrote
pf->flags which removed various key flags including the MSI-X settings.

Additionally, it was intended that we have now two flags,
HW_ATR_EVICT_CAPABLE and HW_ATR_EVICT_ENABLED, but this was not done,
and we accidentally were mis-using HW_ATR_EVICT_CAPABLE everywhere.

This patch adds the missing piece, HW_ATR_EVICT_ENABLED, and safely
updates pf->flags instead of overwriting it.

Without this patch we will have many problems including disabling MSI-X
support, and we'll attempt to use HW ATR eviction on devices which do
not support it.

"[NET] fib_rules: goto rule action

This patch adds a new rule action FR_ACT_GOTO which allows
to skip a set of rules by jumping to another rule. The rule
to jump to is specified via the FRA_GOTO attribute which
carries a rule preference.

Referring to a rule which doesn't exists is explicitely allowed.
Such goto rules are marked with the flag FIB_RULE_UNRESOLVED
and will act like a rule with a non-matching selector. The rule
will become functional as soon as its target is present.

The goto action enables performance optimizations by reducing
the average number of rules that have to be passed per lookup.

"Properly set [v]array flag in header for casts

Summary:
Properly set/clear the varray flag in ArrayData for casts to/from varrays. As a
result of this, CastArray and CastVArray are no longer no-ops on array inputs,
so deal with that in the JIT and HHBBC as appropriate. Add more assertions to
verify the sanity of the [d,v]array flags.

"Add Shallow_decl_defs.decl type

Summary: I think it would be easier to understand the output of the direct decl parser tests if decls were presented in the same order they appear in in the file. This is difficult to do with the current structure of the `decls` type, which partitions decls into separate maps for functions, classes, typedefs, records, and constants. Instead, I'm suggesting that we use a new type `Shallow_decl_defs.decl`, which is a variant type containing all five kinds of decl, and represent the collection of decls parsed from a file with a `(string * decl) list`.

"Fix loop codegen to be less inane

Summary:
As described in the TODOs this deletes...

for `while` and `for` loops we emit bytecode to evaluate the loop condition twice, as, e.g.:

  ...
    <evaluate condition>
    JmpZ .break
  .start:
    <loop body>
  .continue:
    <evaluate condition>
    JmpNZ .start
  .break:
  ...

when it is much simpler to generate the condition once with an unconditional jump backwards:

  .continue:
    <evaluate condition>
    JmpZ .break
    <loop body>
    Jmp .continue
  .break:

we also suspect this will play more nicely with subsequent codegen but running servicelabs to make sure we don't expose any nasty effects.

This patch removes all places in netfilter that check/set skb->tstamp:

1. To fix the bogus ""start"" time seen with conntrack timestamping for
   outgoing packets, never use skb->tstamp and always use current time.
2. In nfqueue and nflog, only use skb->tstamp for incoming packets,
   as determined by current hook (prerouting, input, forward).
3. xt_time has to use system clock as well rather than skb->tstamp.

   excluded the shared library libcom_err.so from the game

It's also wrong to check st.st_mode & S_IFMT against S_IFREG and then
checking it again with the macro S_ISREG(), since they'll both always
evaluate to true.

Instead, we remove the case statement and only use a simple S_ISREG()

it caused a problem with MSVC v.16.00.40219.01 for 80x86, which defines

"PCI: Enable quirks for PCIe ACS on Intel PCH root ports

Many of the currently available Intel PCH-based root ports do not provide
PCIe ACS capabilities.  Without this, we must assume that peer-to-peer
traffic between multifunction root ports and between devices behind root
ports is possible.  This lack of isolation is exposed by grouping the
devices together in the same IOMMU group.  If we want to expose these
devices to userspace, vfio uses IOMMU groups as the unit of ownership, thus
making it very difficult to assign individual devices to separate users.

The good news is that the chipset does provide ACS-like isolation
capabilities, but we do need to verify and enable those capabilities if the
BIOS has not done so.  This patch implements the device specific enabling
and testing of equivalent ACS function for these devices.

"perf machine: Protect the machine->threads with a rwlock

In addition to using refcounts for the struct thread lifetime
management, we need to protect access to machine->threads from
concurrent access.

That happens in 'perf top', where a thread processes events, inserting
and deleting entries from that rb_tree while another thread decays
hist_entries, that end up dropping references and ultimately deleting
threads from the rb_tree and releasing its resources when no further
hist_entry (or other data structures, like in 'perf sched') references
it.

So the rule is the same for refcounts + protected trees in the kernel,
get the tree lock, find object, bump the refcount, drop the tree lock,
return, use object, drop the refcount if no more use of it is needed,
keep it if storing it in some other data structure, drop when releasing
that data structure.

I.e. pair ""t = machine__find(new)_thread()"" with a ""thread__put(t)"", and
""perf_event__preprocess_sample(&al)"" with ""addr_location__put(&al)"".

The addr_location__put() one is because as we return references to
several data structures, we may end up adding more reference counting
for the other data structures and then we'll drop it at
addr_location__put() time.

"btrfs: handle sectorsize < PAGE_SIZE case for extent buffer accessors

To support sectorsize < PAGE_SIZE case, we need to take extra care of
extent buffer accessors.

Since sectorsize is smaller than PAGE_SIZE, one page can contain
multiple tree blocks, we must use eb->start to determine the real offset
to read/write for extent buffer accessors.

This patch introduces two helpers to do this:

- get_eb_page_index()
  This is to calculate the index to access extent_buffer::pages.
  It's just a simple wrapper around ""start >> PAGE_SHIFT"".

  For sectorsize == PAGE_SIZE case, nothing is changed.
  For sectorsize < PAGE_SIZE case, we always get index as 0, and
  the existing page shift also works.

- get_eb_offset_in_page()
  This is to calculate the offset to access extent_buffer::pages.
  This needs to take extent_buffer::start into consideration.

  For sectorsize == PAGE_SIZE case, extent_buffer::start is always
  aligned to PAGE_SIZE, thus adding extent_buffer::start to
  offset_in_page() won't change the result.
  For sectorsize < PAGE_SIZE case, adding extent_buffer::start gives
  us the correct offset to access.

This patch will touch the following parts to cover all extent buffer
accessors:

- BTRFS_SETGET_HEADER_FUNCS()
- read_extent_buffer()
- read_extent_buffer_to_user()
- memcmp_extent_buffer()
- write_extent_buffer_chunk_tree_uuid()
- write_extent_buffer_fsid()
- write_extent_buffer()
- memzero_extent_buffer()
- copy_extent_buffer_full()
- copy_extent_buffer()
- memcpy_extent_buffer()
- memmove_extent_buffer()

net: add phylink support for PCS

This series adds support for IEEE 802.3 register set compliant PCS
for phylink.  In order to do this, we:

1. convert BUG_ON() in existing accessors to WARN_ON_ONCE() and return
   an error.
2. add accessors for modifying a MDIO device register, and use them in
   phylib, rather than duplicating the code from phylib.
3. add support for decoding the advertisement from clause 22 compatible
   register sets for clause 37 advertisements and SGMII advertisements.
4. add support for clause 45 register sets for 10GBASE-R PCS.

These have been tested on the LX2160A Clearfog-CX platform.

v2: eliminate use of BUG_ON() in the accessors.

If we return the returned value of the mutator call straight away, that will disable the firing of

Returning from the mutator call will also break method chaining as intended by returning `$this` at the end of this method."

"ext4: fix off-by-one on max nr_pages in ext4_find_unwritten_pgoff()

ext4_find_unwritten_pgoff() is used to search for offset of hole or
data in page range [index, end] (both inclusive), and the max number
of pages to search should be at least one, if end == index.
Otherwise the only page is missed and no hole or data is found,
which is not correct.

When block size is smaller than page size, this can be demonstrated
by preallocating a file with size smaller than page size and writing
data to the last block. E.g. run this xfs_io command on a 1k block
size ext4 on x86_64 host.

  # xfs_io -fc ""falloc 0 3k"" -c ""pwrite 2k 1k"" \
  	    -c ""seek -d 0"" /mnt/ext4/testfile
  wrote 1024/1024 bytes at offset 2048
  1 KiB, 1 ops; 0.0000 sec (42.459 MiB/sec and 43478.2609 ops/sec)
  Whence  Result
  DATA    EOF

Data at offset 2k was missed, and lseek(2) returned ENXIO.

This is unconvered by generic/285 subtest 07 and 08 on ppc64 host,
where pagesize is 64k. Because a recent change to generic/285
reduced the preallocated file size to smaller than 64k.

"dt-bindings: one binding file for all simple panels

There is an increasing number of new simple panels.
Common for many of these simple panels are that they have one
mandatory power-supply and some of them have backlight and / or
an enable gpio.

The binding file to describe these panels adds overhead
that really do not add value.
The binding are known and there is nothing gained from a
dedicated binding file nor for any dedicated example.

The following patch introduces a single panel-simple.yaml
and converts two ampire bindings over to the new file.

The conversion - if applied will have following effects:

- The maintainer for the individual file will change
    There is no need for many different maintainers for a simple binding.
    We have the same situation with the panel-simple driver in the kernel.

- The license will change to (GPL-2.0-only OR BSD-2-Clause)
    There is usually only a single line copied from the original
    file, a line that is often copied from a datasheet.
    This license change should be acceptable considered what little
    is copied.
    If the license change is not OK we can use a dedicated binding
    file in these cases.

This is a follow-up on Rob's big patch converting a lot of panel bindings
to individual files:

""dt-bindings: display: Convert a bunch of panels to DT schema""
https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/1197683/

The objectives with one file for the relevant simple panels are:
- Make it simpler to add bindings for simple panels
- Keep the number of bindings file lower and thus easier to find a
  relevant file to copy from when adding new panels.
- Keep the binding documentation for simple panels more consistent
- Make it simpler to add support for new panels

v3:
  - Whitespace fix (checkpatch)
  - Indent compatible (Rob h)
  - Indent comments to give compatible more visibility (Rob h)

v2:
  - spelling fixes (imirkin via irc, Rob)
  - updated description (Rob)
  - list properires in alphabetical order
  - added power-supply to example (Rob)
  - updated title
  - reworded changelog a little

"bnx2x: Fix bridged GSO for 57710/57711 chips

It was recently found out that GSO on 57710/57711 was broken, due to packets

Commit 057cf65 ""bnx2x: Fix GSO for 57710/57711 chips"" partially fixed this
issue, but failed to set the correct IP checksum when receiving GSO packets
via bridges, as such packets enter bnx2x_tx_split() and the FW flags needed

"libfc: Do not invoke the response handler after fc_exch_done()

While the FCoE initiator driver invokes fc_exch_done() from inside

fc_exch_done() from outside the libfc response handler. The object
fc_exch.arg points at may disappear as soon as fc_exch_done() has

this guarantee is provided if fc_exch_done() is invoked from

"time: convert arch_gettimeoffset to a pointer

Currently, whenever CONFIG_ARCH_USES_GETTIMEOFFSET is enabled, each
arch core provides a single implementation of arch_gettimeoffset(). In
many cases, different sub-architectures, different machines, or
different timer providers exist, and so the arch ends up implementing
arch_gettimeoffset() as a call-through-pointer anyway. Examples are
ARM, Cris, M68K, and it's arguable that the remaining architectures,
M32R and Blackfin, should be doing this anyway.

Modify arch_gettimeoffset so that it itself is a function pointer, which
the arch initializes. This will allow later changes to move the
initialization of this function into individual machine support or timer
drivers. This is particularly useful for code in drivers/clocksource
which should rely on an arch-independant mechanism to register their
implementation of arch_gettimeoffset().

This patch also converts the Cris architecture to set arch_gettimeoffset
directly to the final implementation in time_init(), because Cris already
had separate time_init() functions per sub-architecture. M68K and ARM
are converted to set arch_gettimeoffset to the final implementation in
later patches, because they already have function pointers in place for
this purpose.

"net: ena: fix theoretical Rx hang on low memory systems

For the rare case where the device runs out of free rx buffer
descriptors (in case of pressure on kernel  memory),
and the napi handler continuously fail to refill new Rx descriptors
until device rx queue totally runs out of all free rx buffers
to post incoming packet, leading to a deadlock:
* The device won't send interrupts since all the new
Rx packets will be dropped.
* The napi handler won't try to allocate new Rx descriptors
since allocation is part of NAPI that's not being invoked any more

The fix involves detecting this scenario and rescheduling NAPI
(to refill buffers) by the keepalive/watchdog task.

"can: c_can: Remove EOB exit

The rx_poll code has the following gem:

	if (msg_ctrl_save & IF_MCONT_EOB)
		return num_rx_pkts;

The EOB bit is the indicator for the hardware that this is the last
configured FIFO object. But this object can contain valid data, if we
manage to free up objects before the overrun case hits.

Now if the code exits due to the EOB bit set, then this buffer is
stale and the interrupt bit and NewDat bit of the buffer are still
set. Results in a nice interrupt storm unless we come into an overrun
situation where the MSGLST bit gets set.

     ksoftirqd/0-3     [000] ..s.    79.124101: c_can_poll: rx_poll: val: 00008001 pend 00008001

     ksoftirqd/0-3     [000] ..s.    79.124187: c_can_poll: rx_poll: val: 00008002 pend 00008002

The amazing thing is that the check of the MSGLST (aka overrun bit)
used to be after the check of the EOB bit. That was ""fixed"" in commit
5d0f801a2c(can: c_can: Fix RX message handling, handle lost message
before EOB). But the author of this ""fix"" did not even understand that
the EOB check is broken as well.

"Caching code for reading the ssh_known_hosts file.

When you have thousands of machines, re-parsing the ssh_known_hosts file
once per reply becomes extremely expensive (to the point where you
spend several seconds on the CPU, just doing that work). This results
in discovery failing to find a bunch of hosts, as the discovery timeout
is for replies to both be recieved and validated, and the validation
can take longer than the timeout.

By instead only reading the file once, we avoid that, meaning that we
can sensibly discover hundreds or thousands of hosts within the
discovery timeout.

This works nicely, however it won't work so well for registration as in
that case the known_hosts file IS opened by the server, and so will be
cached forever, which isn't desireable.."

"x86/kvm: Sanitize kvm_async_pf_task_wait()

While working on the entry consolidation I stumbled over the KVM async page
fault handler and kvm_async_pf_task_wait() in particular. It took me a
while to realize that the randomly sprinkled around rcu_irq_enter()/exit()
invocations are just cargo cult programming. Several patches ""fixed"" RCU
splats by curing the symptoms without noticing that the code is flawed 
from a design perspective.

The main problem is that this async injection is not based on a proper
handshake mechanism and only respects the minimal requirement, i.e. the
guest is not in a state where it has interrupts disabled.

Aside of that the actual code is a convoluted one fits it all swiss army
knife. It is invoked from different places with different RCU constraints:

  1) Host side:

     vcpu_enter_guest()
       kvm_x86_ops->handle_exit()
         kvm_handle_page_fault()
           kvm_async_pf_task_wait()

     The invocation happens from fully preemptible context.

  2) Guest side:

     The async page fault interrupted:

         a) user space

	 b) preemptible kernel code which is not in a RCU read side
	    critical section

     	 c) non-preemtible kernel code or a RCU read side critical section
	    or kernel code with CONFIG_PREEMPTION=n which allows not to
	    differentiate between #2b and #2c.

RCU is watching for:

  #1  The vCPU exited and current is definitely not the idle task

  #2a The #PF entry code on the guest went through enter_from_user_mode()
      which reactivates RCU

  #2b There is no preemptible, interrupts enabled code in the kernel
      which can run with RCU looking away. (The idle task is always
      non preemptible).

I.e. all schedulable states (#1, #2a, #2b) do not need any of this RCU
voodoo at all.

In #2c RCU is eventually not watching, but as that state cannot schedule
anyway there is no point to worry about it so it has to invoke
rcu_irq_enter() before running that code. This can be optimized, but this
will be done as an extra step in course of the entry code consolidation
work.

So the proper solution for this is to:

  - Split kvm_async_pf_task_wait() into schedule and halt based waiting
    interfaces which share the enqueueing code.

  - Add comments (condensed form of this changelog) to spare others the
    time waste and pain of reverse engineering all of this with the help of
    uncomprehensible changelogs and code history.

  - Invoke kvm_async_pf_task_wait_schedule() from kvm_handle_page_fault(),
    user mode and schedulable kernel side async page faults (#1, #2a, #2b)

  - Invoke kvm_async_pf_task_wait_halt() for the non schedulable kernel
    case (#2c).

    For this case also remove the rcu_irq_exit()/enter() pair around the
    halt as it is just a pointless exercise:

       - vCPUs can VMEXIT at any random point and can be scheduled out for
         an arbitrary amount of time by the host and this is not any
         different except that it voluntary triggers the exit via halt.

       - The interrupted context could have RCU watching already. So the
	 rcu_irq_exit() before the halt is not gaining anything aside of
	 confusing the reader. Claiming that this might prevent RCU stalls
	 is just an illusion.

"Fix paginated queries so they dont slow down as they progress

The query code would use the resultLimit variable to detect when it
should exit out of the query loop. It was also using it to tell lucene
the max number of results to return. This meant that as we were
approaching the limit for the current page, we asked lucene to give
us less and less results. Instead lucene should always give us at least
page worth of results, which we can then filter and keep going if
necessery.

There is no easy way to reproduce this: i found it by running
serviceHostRestartWithDurableServices with 20,000 services and because
this test deletes a couple, ending up with 19998 services, and a default
page size of 1000 for factory self query limit on restart, it would timeout.

I will add a special CI job on jenkins to cover this case, starting
100 services, stopping the host, and restarting

"Use an updateable DocValue to track current document versions.

This change adds a new document indexing option which instructs the
Xenon runtime to maintain metadata attributes, such as whether the
document is the current version for its service, as Lucene DocValue
attributes which are updates as they change. This enables fast
query performance on large indexes, since the filtering of these
documents can be done by the query itself instead of by post-
filtering.

Callers must enable DocumentIndexingOption.INDEX_METADATA on the
services for which this metadata should be maintained, and must
specify QueryOption.INDEXED_METADATA in order to make use of the
new functionality at query time.

Services which enable these options will see reduced indexing
performance:

  - For 50000 POST operations, the median indexing time increased by
    approximately 24%.
  - For 30000 PATCH operations, the median indexing time increased
    by approximately 19%.

However, query performance improves significantly for larger index
sizes. With 5m documents (10k services, 500 updates), a simple self-
link query increases median throughput by approximately 750% (from
1200 queries per second to 10k) with no interleaved updates and by
350% (from 250 queries per second to 1200) with updates.

The `wp_mail()` function has the ability to add attachments to emails. There is currently no way to add attachments to the recovery mode email sent out to site admins when a PHP error is encountered on their site.

This change adds that ability through the use of the `recovery_mode_email` filter, allowing developers to use the full capabilities of `wp_mail()`.

"rndis_wlan: workaround device not returning bss for currently connected AP

BCM4320a devices do not return bss for currently connected AP in bss-list,
althought this is required by NDIS specs. Missing bss leads to warning at

Workaround this by crafting bss manually with information we can read from
device. Workaround is only used when device bss-list does not return current
bss, and so is only used with BCM4320a devices and not newer BCM4320b ones.

"xen/events/fifo: Handle linked events when closing a port

An event channel bound to a CPU that was offlined may still be linked
on that CPU's queue.  If this event channel is closed and reused,
subsequent events will be lost because the event channel is never
unlinked and thus cannot be linked onto the correct queue.

When a channel is closed and the event is still linked into a queue,
ensure that it is unlinked before completing.

If the CPU to which the event channel bound is online, spin until the
event is handled by that CPU. If that CPU is offline, it can't handle
the event, so clear the event queue during the close, dropping the
events.

This fixes the missing interrupts (and subsequent disk stalls etc.)
when offlining a CPU.

Commit 37c8a5fafa3b (""kbuild: consolidate Devicetree dtb build rules"")
moved the location of 'dtbs_install' target which caused dtbs to not be
installed when building debian package with 'bindeb-pkg' target. Update
the builddeb script to use the same logic that determines if there's a
'dtbs_install' target which is presence of the arch dts directory. Also,
use CONFIG_OF_EARLY_FLATTREE instead of CONFIG_OF as that's a better
indication of whether we are building dtbs.

This commit will also have the side effect of installing dtbs on any
arch that has dts files. Previously, it was dependent on whether the
arch defined 'dtbs_install'.

"ARC: u-boot args: check that magic number is correct

In case of devboards we really often disable bootloader and load
Linux image in memory via JTAG. Even if kernel tries to verify
uboot_tag and uboot_arg there is sill a chance that we treat some
garbage in registers as valid u-boot arguments in JTAG case.
E.g. it is enough to have '1' in r0 to treat any value in r2 as
a boot command line.

So check that magic number passed from u-boot is correct and drop
u-boot arguments otherwise. That helps to reduce the possibility
of using garbage as u-boot arguments in JTAG case.

We can safely check U-boot magic value (0x0) in linux passed via
r1 register as U-boot pass it from the beginning. So there is no
backward-compatibility issues.

"drm/amd/display: support ""dummy pstate""

[why]
Existing support in DC for pstate only accounts for a single latency.  This is sufficient when the
variance of latency is small, or that pstate support isn't necessary for correct ASIC functionality.

Newer ASICs violate both existing assumptions.  PState support is mandatory of correct ASIC
functionality, but not all latencies have to be supported.  Existing code supports a ""full p state"" which
allows memory clock to change, but is hard for DCN to support (as it requires very large buffers).
New code will now fall back to a ""dummy p state"" support when ""full p state"" cannot be support.
This easy p state support should always be allowed.

[how]
Define a new latency in socBB.  Add fallback logic to support it.  Note DML is also updated to ensure
that fallback will always work.

"usb: host: xhci: Fix Compliance Mode on SN65LVPE502CP Hardware

This patch is intended to work around a known issue on the
SN65LVPE502CP USB3.0 re-driver that can delay the negotiation
between a device and the host past the usual handshake timeout.

If that happens on the first insertion, the host controller
port will enter in Compliance Mode and NO port status event will
be generated (as per xHCI Spec) making impossible to detect this
event by software. The port will remain in compliance mode until
a warm reset is applied to it.

As a result of this, the port will seem ""dead"" to the user and no
device connections or disconnections will be detected.

For solving this, the patch creates a timer which polls every 2
seconds the link state of each host controller's port (this
by reading the PORTSC register) and recovers the port by issuing a
Warm reset every time Compliance mode is detected.

If a xHC USB3.0 port has previously entered to U0, the compliance
mode issue will NOT occur only until system resumes from
sleep/hibernate, therefore, the compliance mode timer is stopped
when all xHC USB 3.0 ports have entered U0. The timer is initialized
again after each system resume.

Since the issue is being caused by a piece of hardware, the timer
will be enabled ONLY on those systems that have the SN65LVPE502CP
installed (this patch uses DMI strings for detecting those systems)
therefore making this patch to act as a quirk (XHCI_COMP_MODE_QUIRK
has been added to the xhci stack).

This patch applies for these systems:
Vendor: Hewlett-Packard. System Models: Z420, Z620 and Z820.

This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 3.2, as that was
the first kernel to support warm reset.  The kernels will need to
contain both commit 10d674a82e553cb8a1f41027bb3c3e309b3f6804 ""USB: When
hot reset for USB3 fails, try warm reset"" and commit
8bea2bd37df08aaa599aa361a9f8b836ba98e554 ""usb: Add support for root hub
port status CAS"".  The first patch add warm reset support, and the
second patch modifies the USB core to issue a warm reset when the port
is in compliance mode.

"bcache: fix race between setting bdev state to none and new write request direct to backing

There is a race condition in detaching as below:
A. detaching			B. Write request
(1) writing back
(2) write back done, set bdev

(3) cached_dev_put() and
    schedule_work(&dc->detach);
				(4) write data [0 - 4K] directly

(5) power-failure...

When we restart this bcache device, this bdev is clean but not detached,
and read [0 - 4K], we will get unexpected old data from cache device.

To fix this problem, set the bdev state to none when we writeback done
in detaching, and then if power-failure happened as above, the data in
cache will not be used in next bcache device starting, it's detached, we
will read the correct data from backing derectly.

"drm: Don't race connector registration

I was under the misconception that the sysfs dev stuff can be fully
set up, and then registered all in one step with device_add. That's
true for properties and property groups, but not for parents and child
devices. Those must be fully registered before you can register a
child.

Add a bit of tracking to make sure that asynchronous mst connector
hotplugging gets this right. For consistency we rely upon the implicit
barriers of the connector->mutex, which is taken anyway, to ensure
that at least either the connector or device registration call will
work out.

Mildly tested since I can't reliably reproduce this on my mst box
here.

"[ARM] 3044/1: Fix sparse warnings about incompatible pointer types for register defined in pxa-regs.h

Patch from Ian Campbell

The sparse warning initially surfaced in sound/arm/pxa2xx-ac97.c
because it was using u32 * variables to hold the unsigned long *
register addresses.

I submitted an ALSA patch for this http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.alsa.devel/27804 issue and it was suggested that it might be preferable to change the register
definitions to use u32.

Most other subarches seem to use u32 for their register type, at least
the ones which use a __REG macro (like the PXA) do. Nico indicated in
the thread above that he wouldn't mind this patch.

Changing the type required fixes for opposite warnings in the pxa2xx usb

"PM / Domains: Add new helper functions for device-tree

Ideally, if we are returning a reference to a PM domain via a call to

to determine if a PM domain can be safely removed. Alternatively, it is
possible to avoid such external references by providing APIs to access
the PM domain and hence, eliminate any calls to
of_genpd_get_from_provider().

"Don't force comment pagination.

[34561] instituted the policy of forcing pagination for comments. This strategy
was intended to avert problems when 'page_comments' is set to 0 - as it is by
default - and the number of comments on a given post rises into the hundreds or
thousands. By forcing pagination in all cases, we ensured that WordPress would
not time out by processing unwieldy numbers of comments on a given pageload.

The strategy proves problematic, however, because comment permalinks are
generated using the page of the comment. Forcing pagination for posts that
were not previously paginated would change the URL of all comments that do not
appear on the default comment page.

This changeset reintroduces the 'page_comments' setting and its corresponding
checkbox on Settings > Discussion. A number of tests, which were written after
[34561], are modified to work now that 'page_comments' will, once again, be

"motion_est: fix use of inline on extern functions

Inline functions declared without extern do not provide an external
definition in standard C99.  This code only works because most
compilers do not implement the inline semantics correctly.  With a
stricter compiler, linking fails with unresolved references to these
functions.

Declaring the functions extern inline works correctly with some
compilers while some others still fail to create external definitions.

For maximum portability, create a static inline version with an
externally visible wrapper for ff_get_mb_score.  ff_epzs_motion_search
is so large that no sane compiler inlines it anyway, so there the
inline keyword can simply be dropped with no effect.

"powerpc/powernv: call OPAL_QUIESCE before OPAL_SIGNAL_SYSTEM_RESET

Although it is often possible to recover a CPU that was interrupted
from OPAL with a system reset NMI, it's undesirable to interrupt them
for a few reasons. Firstly because dump/debug code itself needs to
call firmware, so it could hang on a lock or possibly corrupt a
per-cpu data structure if it or another CPU was interrupted from
OPAL. Secondly, the kexec crash dump code will not return from
interrupt to unwind the OPAL call.

Call OPAL_QUIESCE with QUIESCE_HOLD before sending an NMI IPI to
another CPU, which wait for it to leave firmware (or time out) to
avoid this problem in normal conditions. Firmware bugs may still
result in a timeout and interrupting OPAL, but that is the best
option (stops the CPU, and possibly allows firmware to be debugged).

"pinctrl: bcm2835: Use raw spinlock for RT compatibility

The BCM2835 pinctrl driver acquires a spinlock in its ->irq_enable,
->irq_disable and ->irq_set_type callbacks.  Spinlocks become sleeping
locks with CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT_FULL=y, therefore invocation of one of the
callbacks in atomic context may cause a hard lockup if at least two GPIO
pins in the same bank are used as interrupts.  The issue doesn't occur
with just a single interrupt pin per bank because the lock is never
contended.  I'm experiencing such lockups with GPIO 8 and 28 used as
level-triggered interrupts, i.e. with ->irq_disable being invoked on
reception of every IRQ.

The critical section protected by the spinlock is very small (one bitop
and one RMW of an MMIO register), hence converting to a raw spinlock
seems a better trade-off than converting the driver to threaded IRQ
handling (which would increase latency to handle an interrupt).

In practice can never happen because only the first caller which
increments iosf_mbi_block_punit_i2c_access_count will also take
iosf_mbi_punit_mutex, that is the whole purpose of the counter, which
itself is protected by iosf_mbi_block_punit_i2c_access_count_mutex.

But there is no way to tell the lockdep code about this and we really
want to be able to run a kernel with lockdep enabled without these
warnings being triggered.

2. The lockdep warning also points out another real problem, if 2 threads
both are in a block of code protected by iosf_mbi_block_punit_i2c_access
and the first thread to acquire the block exits before the second thread
then the second thread will call mutex_unlock on iosf_mbi_punit_mutex,
but it is not the thread which took the mutex and unlocking by another
thread is not allowed.

Fix this by getting rid of the notion of holding a mutex for the entire
duration of the PMIC accesses, be it either from the PUnit side, or from an
in kernel I2C driver. In general holding a mutex after exiting a function
is a bad idea and the above problems show this case is no different.

Instead 2 counters are now used, one for PMIC accesses from the PUnit
and one for accesses from in kernel I2C code. When access is requested
now the code will wait (using a waitqueue) for the counter of the other
type of access to reach 0 and on release, if the counter reaches 0 the
wakequeue is woken.

Note that the counter approach is necessary to allow nested calls.
The main reason for this is so that a series of i2c transfers can be done
with the punit blocked from accessing the bus the whole time. This is
necessary to be able to safely read/modify/write a PMIC register without
racing with the PUNIT doing the same thing.

Allowing nested iosf_mbi_block_punit_i2c_access() calls also is desirable
from a performance pov since the whole dance necessary to block the PUnit
from accessing the PMIC I2C bus is somewhat expensive.

"vsprintf: Replace memory barrier with static_key for random_ptr_key update

Reviewing Tobin's patches for getting pointers out early before
entropy has been established, I noticed that there's a lone smp_mb() in
the code. As with most lone memory barriers, this one appears to be
incorrectly used.

We currently basically have this:

	get_random_bytes(&ptr_key, sizeof(ptr_key));
	/*
	 * have_filled_random_ptr_key==true is dependent on get_random_bytes().
	 * ptr_to_id() needs to see have_filled_random_ptr_key==true
	 * after get_random_bytes() returns.
	 */
	smp_mb();
	WRITE_ONCE(have_filled_random_ptr_key, true);

And later we have:

	if (unlikely(!have_filled_random_ptr_key))
		return string(buf, end, ""(ptrval)"", spec);

/* Missing memory barrier here. */

	hashval = (unsigned long)siphash_1u64((u64)ptr, &ptr_key);

As the CPU can perform speculative loads, we could have a situation
with the following:

	CPU0				CPU1
	----				----
				   load ptr_key = 0
   store ptr_key = random
   smp_mb()
   store have_filled_random_ptr_key

				   load have_filled_random_ptr_key = true

				    BAD BAD BAD! (you're so bad!)

Because nothing prevents CPU1 from loading ptr_key before loading
have_filled_random_ptr_key.

But this race is very unlikely, but we can't keep an incorrect smp_mb() in
place. Instead, replace the have_filled_random_ptr_key with a static_branch
not_filled_random_ptr_key, that is initialized to true and changed to false
when we get enough entropy. If the update happens in early boot, the
static_key is updated immediately, otherwise it will have to wait till
entropy is filled and this happens in an interrupt handler which can't
enable a static_key, as that requires a preemptible context. In that case, a
work_queue is used to enable it, as entropy already took too long to
establish in the first place waiting a little more shouldn't hurt anything.

The benefit of using the static key is that the unlikely branch in
vsprintf() now becomes a nop.

"x86: add MAP_STACK mmap flag

as per this discussion:

   http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/8/12/423

Pardo reported that 64-bit threaded apps, if their stacks exceed the
combined size of ~4GB, slow down drastically in pthread_create() - because
glibc uses MAP_32BIT to allocate the stacks. The use of MAP_32BIT is
a legacy hack - to speed up context switching on certain early model
64-bit P4 CPUs.

So introduce a new flag to be used by glibc instead, to not constrain
64-bit apps like this.

glibc can switch to this new flag straight away - it will be ignored
by the kernel. If those old CPUs ever matter to anyone, support for
it can be implemented.

"tracing: Remove locking trace_types_lock from tracing_reset_all_online_cpus()

Commit a82274151af ""tracing: Protect ftrace_trace_arrays list in trace_events.c""
added taking the trace_types_lock mutex in trace_events.c as there were
several locations that needed it for protection. Unfortunately, it also
encapsulated a call to tracing_reset_all_online_cpus() which also takes
the trace_types_lock, causing a deadlock.

This happens when a module has tracepoints and has been traced. When the
module is removed, the trace events module notifier will grab the
trace_types_lock, do a bunch of clean ups, and also clears the buffer
by calling tracing_reset_all_online_cpus. This doesn't happen often
which explains why it wasn't caught right away.

Commit a82274151af was marked for stable, which means this must be

For drivers that use deferred_xmit for PTP frames (such as sja1105),
there is no need to perform matching between PTP frames and their egress

In that case, it makes sense to have the pointer to the skb clone that
DSA made directly in the skb->cb. It will be used for pushing the egress
timestamp back in the application socket's error queue.

"Merge branch 'for-arm-soc' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/cooloney/linux-leds into next/drivers

From Bryan Wu <bryan.wu@canonical.com>:

Based on Linus Walleij's ARM LED consolidation work, this patchset introduce a
new generic led trigger for CPU not only for ARM but also for others.

For enabling CPU idle event, CPU arch code should call ledtrig_cpu() stub to
trigger idle start or idle end event.

These patches convert old style LED driver in arch/arm to gpio_led or new led
driver interface. Against 3.5 release and build successfully for all the machines.

Test ledtrig-cpu driver on OMAP4 Panda board.

v9 --> v10
 * fix compiling issue on versatile_defconfig reported by Russell King
 * rebase to 3.5 kernel and move patches to new git tree

v8 --> v9:
 * use mutex to replace rw_sema pointed out by Tim Gardner
 * add a new struct led_trigger_cpu
 * add lock_is_inited to record mutex lock initialization

v6 --> v7:
 * add a patch to unify the led-trigger name
 * fix some typo pointed
 * use BUG_ON to detect CPU numbers during building stage

v5 --> v6:
 * replace  __get_cpu_var() to per_cpu()
 * remove smp_processor_id() which is wrong with for_each_possible_cpu()
 * test on real OMAP4 Panda board
 * add comments about CPU hotplug in the CPU LED trigger driver

v4 --> v5:
 * rebase all the patches on top of latest linux-next
 * replace on_each_cpu() with for_each_possible_cpu()
 * add some description of ledtrig_cpu() API
 * remove old leds code from driver nwflash.c, which should use a new led trigger then
 * this trigger driver can be built as module now

v3 --> v4:
 * fix a typo pointed by Jochen Friedrich
 * fix some building errors
 * add Reviewed-by and Tested-by into patch log

v2 --> v3:
 * almost rewrote the whole ledtrig-cpu driver, which is more simple
 * every CPU will have a per-CPU trigger
 * cpu trigger can be assigned to any leds
 * fix a lockdep issue in led-trigger common code
 * other fix according to review

v1 --> v2:
 * remove select operations in Kconfig of every machines
 * add back supporting of led in core module of mach-integrator
 * solidate name scheme in ledtrig-cpu.c
 * add comments of CPU_LED_* cpu led events
 * fold patches of RealView and Versatile together
 * add machine_is_ check during assabet led driver init
 * add some Acked-by in patch logs
 * remove code for simpad machine in machine-sa11000, since Jochen Friedrich
   introduced gpiolib and gpio-led driver for simpad
 * on Assabet and Netwinder machine, LED operations is reversed like:
   setting bit means turn off leds
   clearing bit means turn on leds
 * add a new function to read CM_CTRL register for led driver

* 'for-arm-soc' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/cooloney/linux-leds:

"Input: atmel_mxt_ts - remove unnecessary platform data

It is not necessary to download these values to the maXTouch chip on every
probe, since they are stored in NVRAM. It makes life difficult when tuning
the device to keep them in sync with the config array/file, and requires a
new kernel build for minor tweaks.

These parameters only represent a tiny subset of the available
configuration options, tracking all of these options in platform data would
be a endless task. In addition, different versions of maXTouch chips may
have these values in different places or may not even have them at all.

Having these values also makes life more complex for device tree and other
platforms where having to define a static configuration isn't helpful.

This happens because btrfs_next_old_leaf searches down to our current
key, and then walks up the path until we can move to the next slot, and
then reads back down the path so we get the next leaf.

However it doesn't unlock any lower levels until it replaces them with
the new extent buffer.  This is technically fine, but of course causes
lockdep to complain, because we could be holding locks on lower levels
while locking upper levels.

Fix this by dropping all nodes below the level that we use as our new
starting point before we start reading back down the path.  This also
allows us to drop the nested/recursive locking magic, because we're no
longer locking two nodes at the same level anymore.

"ALSA: firewire-lib: add helper functions as interfaces between packet streaming layer and data block processing layer

ALSA PCM framework uses PCM buffer with a concept of 'period' to
synchronize userspace operations to hardware for nearly-realtime
processing. Each driver implements snd_pcm_period_elapsed() to tell across
of the period boundary to ALSA PCM middleware. To call the function, some
drivers utilize hardware interrupt handlers, the others count handled PCM
frames.

Drivers for sound units on IEEE 1394 bus are the latter. They use two
buffers; PCM buffer and DMA buffer for IEEE 1394 isochronous packet. PCM
frames are copied between these two buffers and 'amdtp_stream' structure
counts the handled PCM frames. Then, snd_pcm_period_elapsed() is called if
required.

Essentially, packet streaming layer should not be responsible for PCM
frame processing. The PCM frame processing should be handled in each data
block processing layer as a result of handling data blocks. Although, PCM
frame counting is a common work for all of protocols which ALSA firewire
stack is going to support.

This commit adds two new helper functions as interfaces between packet
streaming layer to data block processing layer. In future, each data block
processing layer implements these functions. The packet streaming layer
calls data block processing layer per packet by calling the functions. The
data block processing layer processes data blocks and PCM frames, and
returns the number of processed PCM frames. Then the packet streaming layer
calculates handled PCM frames and calls snd_pcm_period_elapsed().

 - listed the PHY maintainers in the new schema. Hopefully, thats ok.
 - fixed a typo in the bindings schema
 - run dtb_checks and dt_binding_check and fixed the schema
 - dropped the rgmii-io-1v8 property; instead provide two regulators vddh

"driver core: Rewrite test_async_driver_probe to cover serialization and NUMA affinity

The current async_probe test code is only testing one device allocated
prior to driver load and only loading one device afterwards. Instead of
doing things this way it makes much more sense to load one device per CPU
in order to actually stress the async infrastructure. By doing this we
should see delays significantly increase in the event of devices being
serialized.

In addition I have updated the test to verify that we are trying to place
the work on the correct NUMA node when we are running in async mode. By
doing this we can verify the best possible outcome for device and driver
load times.

I have added a timeout value that is used to disable the sleep and instead
cause the probe routine to report an error indicating it timed out. By
doing this we limit the maximum runtime for the test to 20 seconds or less.

The last major change in this set is that I have gone through and tuned it
for handling the massive number of possible events that will be scheduled.
Instead of reporting the sleep for each individual device it is moved to
only being displayed if we enable debugging.

With this patch applied below are what a failing test and a passing test
should look like. I elided a few hundred lines in the failing test that
were duplicated since the system I was testing on had a massive number of
CPU cores:

"cpufreq: governor: Make governor private data per-policy

Some fields in struct od_cpu_dbs_info_s and struct cs_cpu_dbs_info_s
are only used for a limited set of CPUs.  Namely, if a policy is
shared between multiple CPUs, those fields will only be used for one
of them (policy->cpu).  This means that they really are per-policy
rather than per-CPU and holding room for them in per-CPU data
structures is generally wasteful.  Also moving those fields into
per-policy data structures will allow some significant simplifications
to be made going forward.

For this reason, introduce struct cs_policy_dbs_info and
struct od_policy_dbs_info to hold those fields.  Define each of the
new structures as an extension of struct policy_dbs_info (such that
struct policy_dbs_info is embedded in each of them) and introduce
new ->alloc and ->free governor callbacks to allocate and free
those structures, respectively, such that ->alloc() will return
a pointer to the struct policy_dbs_info embedded in the allocated
data structure and ->free() will take that pointer as its argument.

With that, modify the code accessing the data fields in question
in per-CPU data objects to look for them in the new structures
via the struct policy_dbs_info pointer available to it and drop
them from struct od_cpu_dbs_info_s and struct cs_cpu_dbs_info_s.

"x86, vsyscall: fix the oops crash with __pa_vsymbol()

Appended patch fixes an oops while changing the vsyscall sysctl.
I am sure no one tested this code before integrating into mainline :(

BTW, using ioremap() in vsyscall_sysctl_change() to get the virtual
address of a kernel symbol sounds like an over kill.. I wonder if we
can define a simple __va_vsymbol() which will return directly the
kernel direct mapping. comments in the code which says gcc has trouble
with __va(__pa()) sounds bogus to me. __pa() on a vsyscall address will
not work anyhow :(

And also, the whole nop out syscall in vsyscall page infrastructure
(vsyscall_sysctl_change()) is added to make some attacks difficult,
and yet I don't see this nop out being done by default. This area
requires more cleanups?

Fix an oops with __pa_vsymbol(). VSYSCALL_FIRST_PAGE is a fixmap index.
We want the starting virtual address of the vsyscall page and not the index.

At some point this should be fixed at the kernel/futex.c level. UP

and SMP cannot function without a working cmpxchg anyway.

The at91_ether driver calls macb_mii_init passing a 'struct macb'

 - register map - davinci's controller is organized into banks of 32 gpios,
   tnetv107x has a single space with arrays of registers for in, out,
   direction, etc.
 - davinci's controller has separate set/clear registers for output, tnetv107x
   has a single direct mapped register.

This patch does not yet add gpio irq support on this controller.

"PCI: derive nearby CPUs from device's instead of bus' NUMA information

In case of AMD CPU northbridge functions this NUMA information might
differ.  Here is an example from a 4-socket system.

Currently Linux shows

  root@hagen:/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1a.4# cat numa_node
  0
  root@hagen:/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1a.4# cat local_cpu*
  0-3
  00000000,0000000f

which is not correct for northbridge functions as the local CPUs
are those of the same socket.

With this patch and a quirk for AMD CPU NB functions Linux can
do better and correctly show

  root@hagen:/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1a.4# cat numa_node
  2
  root@hagen:/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1a.4# cat local_cpu*

This bug has been around for a LONG time.  The MM warning is from late
2005, but the driver merged a year later ...  so I'm puzzled why nobody
noticed this before now.

The fix involves noting that this buffer shouldn't be DMA-coherent; it's
just used for normal DMA writes.  So replace it with standard kmalloc()
buffering and DMA mapping calls.

This is the quickie fix.  A better one would not rely on allocating large
bounce buffers.  (Note that dma_alloc_coherent could have failed too, but
that case was ignored...  kmalloc is a bit more likely to fail though.)

"avformat/mux: Don't modify packets we don't own

The documentation of av_write_frame() explicitly states that the function
doesn't take ownership of the packets sent to it; while av_write_frame()
does not directly unreference the packets after having written them, it
nevertheless modifies the packet in various ways:
1. The timestamps might be modified either by prepare_input_packet() or
compute_muxer_pkt_fields().
2. If a bitstream filter gets applied, it takes ownership of the
reference and the side-data in the packet sent to it.
In case of do_packet_auto_bsf(), the end result is that the returned packet
contains the output of the last bsf in the chain. If an error happens,
a blank packet will be returned; a packet may also simply not lead to
any output (vp9_superframe).
This also implies that side data needs to be really copied and can't be
shared with the input packet.
The method choosen here minimizes copying of data: When the input isn't
refcounted and no bitstream filter is applied, the packet's data will
not be copied.

Notice that packets that contain uncoded frames are exempt from this
because these packets are not owned by and returned to the user. This
also moves unreferencing the packets containing uncoded frames to
av_write_frame() in the noninterleaved codepath; in the interleaved
codepath, these packets are already freed in av_interleaved_write_frame(),
so that unreferencing the packets in write_uncoded_frame_internal() is
no longer needed. It has been removed.

The test failed intermittently with Hazelcast on CI.

When a subscription is removed, it can take some time before the cluster manager invokes our listeners.
It is then possible that we still have in cache a registration that has been effectively removed.

The fix consists in intercepting the registration update event to make sure it has been processed.
Then we can try sending again and we should get the NO_HANDLERS error as expected.

"Staging: iio: Change data type to u16 to avoid unnecessary typecast

In the adis16220_read16bit() function we earlier used a s16 value 'val'
which is used by the adis_read_reg_16 function to read data and takes a
u16 value as a parameter.

So, this patch changes the data type of 'val' from s16 to u16. It is safe
to remove the extra sign extension, since the user of the function uses it
to read a 10 unsigned value which will lead to the same result in both cases.
Further this patch removes the unnecessary typecast for the simplification of
code. In addition to this, initialization of 'val' to 0 is also dropped. This is
due to the fact that not initializing helps the compiler provide useful warnings
if the code gets changed to return an otherwise uninitialized result.

"efi/reboot: Allow powering off machines using EFI

Not only can EfiResetSystem() be used to reboot, it can also be used to
power down machines.

By and large, this functionality doesn't work very well across the range
of EFI machines in the wild, so it should definitely only be used as a
last resort. In an ideal world, this wouldn't be needed at all.

Unfortunately, we're starting to see machines where EFI is the *only*
reliable way to power down, and nothing else, not PCI, not ACPI, works.

efi_poweroff_required() should be implemented on a per-architecture
basis, since exactly when we should be using EFI runtime services is a
platform-specific decision. There's no analogue for reboot because each
architecture handles reboot very differently - the x86 code in
particular is pretty complex.

Patches to enable this for specific classes of hardware will be
submitted separately.

the appropriate setup function.

The purpose of this refactoring is to collect all code
adjusting the rx_max and tx_max buffers in one place, so
that it is easier to call it from multiple call sites.

"tree/tiny rcu: Add debug RCU head objects

Helps finding racy users of call_rcu(), which results in hangs because list
entries are overwritten and/or skipped.

Changelog since v4:
- Bissectability is now OK
- Now generate a WARN_ON_ONCE() for non-initialized rcu_head passed to
  call_rcu(). Statically initialized objects are detected with
  object_is_static().
- Rename rcu_head_init_on_stack to init_rcu_head_on_stack.
- Remove init_rcu_head() completely.

Changelog since v3:
- Include comments from Lai Jiangshan

This new patch version is based on the debugobjects with the newly introduced
""active state"" tracker.

Non-initialized entries are all considered as ""statically initialized"". An
activation fixup (triggered by call_rcu()) takes care of performing the debug
object initialization without issuing any warning. Since we cannot increase the
size of struct rcu_head, I don't see much room to put an identifier for
statically initialized rcu_head structures. So for now, we have to live without
""activation without explicit init"" detection. But the main purpose of this debug
option is to detect double-activations (double call_rcu() use of a rcu_head
before the callback is executed), which is correctly addressed here.

This also detects potential internal RCU callback corruption, which would cause
the callbacks to be executed twice.

"ACPI / hotplug / PCI: Runtime resume bridges before bus rescans

If a PCI bridge (or PCIe port) that is runtime-suspended gets an ACPI
hotplug notification, such as a bus check, it has to be resumed before
re-scanning the devices below it, or those devices will not be
accessible and will be treated as hot-removed.

Make that happen and let the bridge suspend again after the bus below it
has been re-scanned.

This is a replacement for commit 16468c783cb4 (""ACPI / hotplug / PCI:
Runtime resume bridge before rescan"") that has been reverted, because it
introduced a system resume regression (due to missing bridge->pci_dev
checks that are necessary in case the notification is targeted at the
host bridge) and it is necessary for the code added by commit
006d44e49a25 (""PCI: Add runtime PM support for PCIe ports"") to work as
expected.

"clk: composite: .determine_rate support

This commit adds .determine_rate support to the composite clock. It will
use the .determine_rate callback from the rate component if available,
and fall back on the mux component otherwise. This allows composite
clocks to enjoy the benefits of automatic clock reparenting.

"Merge branch 'for_net-next-5.1/rds-tos-v4' of git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ssantosh/linux

Santosh Shilimkar says:

====================
rds: add tos support

RDS applications make use of tos to classify database traffic.
This feature has been used in shipping products from 2.6.32 based
kernels. Its tied with RDS v4.1 protocol version and the compatibility
gets negotiated as part of connections setup.

Patchset keeps full backward compatibility using existing connection
negotiation scheme. Currently the feature is exploited by RDMA
transport and for TCP transport the user tos values are mapped to
same default class (0).

For RDMA transports, RDMA CM service type API is used to
set up different SL(service lanes) and the IB fabric is configured
for tos mapping using Subnet Manager(SL to VL mappings).
Similarly for ROCE fabric, user priority is mapped with different
DSCP code points which are associated with different switch queues
in the fabric.

The original code was developed by Bang Nguyen in downstream kernel back in
2.6.32 kernel days and it has evolved significantly over period of time.

Thanks to Yanjun for doing testing with various combinations of host like
v3.1<->v4.1, v4.1.<->v3.1, v4.1 upstream to shipping v4.1 etc etc

"GVN should not replace values with ones with less specific types

Summary:
GVN will look through instructions marked pass-through and potentially replace
any usages of the dest with the src. However, some pass-through instructions,
even though they conceptually do not change the value, may refine type
information. So, if GVN replaces a usage of a dest of a pass-through instruction
with that instruction's source, we could actually lose refined type
information. This may manifest itself as a pessimization, but it can also cause
incorrect IR to be generated. For example, if the usage of a dest of a
CastCtxThis instruction is replaced by the CastCtxThis' source, you've replaced
a value representing a TObj, with one that is TObj|TCctx, which isn't
equivalent. Fix all of this by only performing the substitution if the new
value's type is not less refined than the original.

"swresample: actually reinit resampler on large speed changes

If the speed is changed by a large amount, we need to effectively change
the output rate by a large amount, and swr_set_compensation() is
apparently not designed to handle such large changes well. So it's
better to reinitialize the resampler on all large changes.

Also, strictly reinitialize the resampler if the rate changes, otherwise
it could happen that libavresample (which does not automatically
initialize resampling if avresample_set_compensation() is used) would
never apply speed changes properly.

Also document some conditions better that handle corner cases (remove
the inline condition from the if gating the compensation code).

It also appears that we crashed with very large compensation ratios
(when raising audio speed quickly by keeping the ""["" key down), and this
commit accidentally mitigates it by not allowing large compensation."

"parisc: disable -mlong-calls compiler option for kernel modules

CONFIG_MLONGCALLS was introduced in commit
ec758f98328da3eb933a25dc7a2eed01ef44d849 to overcome linker issues when linking
huge linux kernels, e.g. with many modules linked in.

But in the kernel module loader there is no support yet for the new relocation
types, which is why modules built with -mlong-calls can't be loaded.
Furthermore, for modules long calls are not really necessary, since we already
use stub sections which resolve long distance calls.

So, let's just disable this compiler option when compiling kernel modules.

"sched: Fix missing preemption opportunity

If an interrupt fires in cond_resched(), between the call to __schedule()
and the PREEMPT_ACTIVE count decrementation, and that interrupt sets
TIF_NEED_RESCHED, the call to preempt_schedule_irq() will be ignored
due to the PREEMPT_ACTIVE count. This kind of scenario, with irq preemption
being delayed because it's interrupting a preempt-disabled area, is
usually fixed up after preemption is re-enabled back with an explicit
call to preempt_schedule().

This is what preempt_enable() does but a raw preempt count decrement as
performed by __preempt_count_sub(PREEMPT_ACTIVE) doesn't handle delayed
preemption check. Therefore when such a race happens, the rescheduling
is going to be delayed until the next scheduler or preemption entrypoint.
This can be a problem for scheduler latency sensitive workloads.

Lets fix that by consolidating cond_resched() with preempt_schedule()
internals.

"Fix a deadlock in channels, again.

This deadlock was caused when the channel was closed at just the right time, so
the extra `self.cnt.fetch_add` actually should have preserved the DISCONNECTED
state of the channel. by modifying this the channel entered a state such that
the port would never succeed in dropping.

This also moves the increment of self.steals until after the MAX_STEALS block.
The reason for this is that in 'fn recv()' the steals variable is decremented
immediately after the try_recv(), which could in theory set steals to -1 if it
was previously set to 0 in try_recv().

The bar->alloc part of the condition isn't currently necessary (it

"hsr: reset network header when supervision frame is created

The supervision frame is L2 frame.
When supervision frame is created, hsr module doesn't set network header.
If tap routine is enabled, dev_queue_xmit_nit() is called and it checks
network_header. If network_header pointer wasn't set(or invalid),
it resets network_header and warns.
In order to avoid unnecessary warning message, resetting network_header
is needed.

Test commands:
    ip netns add nst
    ip link add veth0 type veth peer name veth1
    ip link add veth2 type veth peer name veth3
    ip link set veth1 netns nst
    ip link set veth3 netns nst
    ip link set veth0 up
    ip link set veth2 up
    ip link add hsr0 type hsr slave1 veth0 slave2 veth2
    ip a a 192.168.100.1/24 dev hsr0

I don't see how such a notice could occur. There is a default value for this node so as soon as the validation node exists, there will be a value for this node. Could you give an example of configuration that causes the notice ?

I don't have any validation node set up in my config in such a case it seems that sub nodes doesn't get build. So it seems that I found a bug in config builder.

This is in fact due to a hackish stuff in the DI extension. It changes the configuration after using the Config component to merge them in the case where you enable the forms without enabling the validator, to force enabling it."

"drm/i915: Don't use VBT for detecting DPCD backlight controls

Despite the fact that the VBT appears to have a field for specifying
that a system is equipped with a panel that supports standard VESA
backlight controls over the DP AUX channel, so far every system we've
spotted DPCD backlight control support on doesn't actually set this
field correctly and all have it set to INTEL_BACKLIGHT_DISPLAY_DDI.

While we don't know the exact reason for this VBT misuse, talking with
some vendors indicated that there's a good number of laptop panels out
there that supposedly support both PWM backlight controls and DPCD
backlight controls as a workaround until Intel supports DPCD backlight
controls across platforms universally. This being said, the X1 Extreme
2nd Gen that I have here (note that Lenovo is not the hardware vendor
that informed us of this) PWM backlight controls are advertised, but
only DPCD controls actually function. I'm going to make an educated
guess here and say that on systems like this one, it's likely that PWM
backlight controls might have been intended to work but were never
really tested by QA.

Since we really need backlights to work without any extra module
parameters, let's take the risk here and rely on the standard DPCD caps
to tell us whether AUX backlight controls are supported or not. We still
check the VBT, just so we can print a debugging message on systems that
advertise DPCD backlight support on the panel but not in the VBT.

Changes since v3:
* Print a debugging message if we enable DPCD backlight control on a
  device which doesn't report DPCD backlight controls in it's VBT,
  instead of warning on custom panel backlight interfaces.

"Merge series ""ASoC: topology: fix error handling flow"" from Pierre-Louis Bossart <pierre-louis.bossart@linux.intel.com>:

While experimenting and introducing errors in Baytrail topology files
until I got them right, I encountered multiple kernel oopses and
memory leaks. This is a first batch to harden the code, but we should
probably think of a tool to fuzz the topology...

Pierre-Louis Bossart (5):
  ASoC: topology: fix kernel oops on route addition error
  ASoC: topology: fix tlvs in error handling for widget_dmixer
  ASoC: topology: use break on errors, not continue
  ASoC: topology: factor kfree(se) in error handling
  ASoC: topology: add more logs when topology load fails.

"x86: save/restore eflags in context switch

(And reset it on new thread creation)

It turns out that eflags is important to save and restore not just
because of iopl, but due to the magic bits like the NT bit, which we
don't want leaking between different threads.

"ethtool: Extend ethtool plugin module eeprom API to phylib

This patch extends the ethtool plugin module eeprom API to support cards
whose phy support is delegated to a separate driver.

The handlers for ETHTOOL_GMODULEINFO and ETHTOOL_GMODULEEEPROM call the
module_info and module_eeprom functions if the phy driver provides them;
otherwise the handlers call the equivalent ethtool_ops functions provided
by network drivers with built-in phy support.

"Input: axp20x-pek - do not register input device on some systems

On some systems (Intel tablets with axp288 pmic) the powerbutton is
also connected to a gpio pin of the SoC, advertised through the
""INTCFD9"" / ""PNP0C40"" acpi device. This leads to double reporting
of powerbutton events, which is undesirable, so one driver needs
to not report input events in this case.

Since the soc_button_array driver for the ""PNP0C40"" acpi device
also handles wake from suspend on these tablets and since the
axp20x-pel driver requires relative expensive i2c accrsses,
it is best for the axp20x-pek driver to not register an input device
in this case.

Note that this commit leaves the axp20x-driver bound to the
device, rather then returning -ENODEV, this is done so that the
sysfs attributes it offers are kept around.

"tracing/ring-buffer: Add unlock recursion protection on discard

The pair of helpers trace_recursive_lock() and trace_recursive_unlock()
have been introduced recently to provide generic tracing recursion
protection.

They are used in a symetric way:

 - trace_recursive_lock() on buffer reserve
 - trace_recursive_unlock() on buffer commit

However sometimes, we don't commit but discard on entry
to the buffer, ie: in case of filter checking.

Then we must also unlock the recursion protection on discard time,
otherwise the tracing gets definitely deactivated and a warning
is raised spuriously, such as:

"Propagate reified generics through Aast for function calls

Summary:
Created a new type in Aast for generics, which just pairs a hint and a bool, and changed the node that represents function calls to contain a `generic list` instead of a `hint list`. Also renamed `hl` to `gl` in the typechecker and used List.unzips to pull out the hint list to make explicit in the dispatch_call section. Finally, forced localization of fun_types to keep arguments when a reified generic appears in the parent, because all type arguments (including erased) must be spelled out in that case.

The rest was just fixing build errors.

When one of the device is missing, bbio_error() takes care of setting
the error status. And if its only IO that is pending in that stripe, it
fails to check the status of the other IO at %bbio_error before setting
the error %bi_status for the %orig_bio. Fix this by checking if
%bbio->error has exceeded the %bbio->max_errors.

Reproducer as below fdatasync error is seen intermittently.

 mount -o degraded /dev/sdc /btrfs
 dd status=none if=/dev/zero of=$(mktemp /btrfs/XXX) bs=4096 count=1 conv=fdatasync

 dd: fdatasync failed for ‘/btrfs/LSe’: Input/output error

 The reason for the intermittences of the problem is because
 the following conditions have to be met, which depends on timing:
 In btrfs_map_bio()
  - the RAID1 the missing device has to be at %dev_nr = 1
 In bbio_error()
  . before bbio_error() is called the bio of the not-missing
    device at %dev_nr = 0 must be completed so that the below
    condition is true
     if (atomic_dec_and_test(&bbio->stripes_pending)) {

"Alternate fix for SPEC-323. r=edburns

This is an alternate proposal to 323.  Instead of having the
logic for setValue(Object) check the javax.faces.INTERPRET_EMPTY_STRING_SUBMITTED_VALUES_AS_NULL
via a FacesContext ThreadLocal lookup, move this logic to 
UIInput.validate() instead.

Doing so here solves three issues.
  1.  Having an additional FacesContext thread local lookup
  2.  Having zero-length Strings pushed to the model 
  3.  Prevent ValueChangeListeners firing when they shouldn't.

Issues 1 and 2 should already be clear, so I'll touch on issue 
3 which was brought up by SAP about a month and a half ago.

Consider:

<h:form id=""form"">
    <h:inputText id=""string""
                 value=""#{bean.stringProperty}""
                 valueChangeListener=""#{bean.valueChange}""/>
</h:form>

Where #{bean.stringProperty} is initially null.  In JSF 1.2, if this
form is submitted without entering any data into the input control,
the ValueChangeListener is triggered when in reality, it shouldn't have
been.

So we resolve this and the other two issues by adding the following
block of code:

         Object submittedValue = getSubmittedValue();
         if (submittedValue == null) {
             return;
         }
 
+        // If non-null, an instanceof String, and we're configured to treat
+        // zero-length Strings as null:
+        //   call setSubmittedValue(null)
+        if ((considerEmptyStringNull(context)
+             && submittedValue instanceof String 
+             && ((String) submittedValue).length() == 0)) {
+            setSubmittedValue(null);
+            submittedValue = null;
+        }
+

If getSubmittedValue() returns null, simply return.

If the javax.faces.INTERPRET_EMPTY_STRING_SUBMITTED_VALUES_AS_NULL
option is enabled, and the submitted value is an empty string,
set the local submittedValue to null and call setSubmittedValue(null).
And continue processing.  Validation won't occur, a VCE won't be triggers
since both the old and new values are null, and the model will get a null
value.

"random32: add noise from network and scheduling activity

With the removal of the interrupt perturbations in previous random32
change (random32: make prandom_u32() output unpredictable), the PRNG
has become 100% deterministic again. While SipHash is expected to be
way more robust against brute force than the previous Tausworthe LFSR,
there's still the risk that whoever has even one temporary access to
the PRNG's internal state is able to predict all subsequent draws till
the next reseed (roughly every minute). This may happen through a side
channel attack or any data leak.

This patch restores the spirit of commit f227e3ec3b5c (""random32: update
the net random state on interrupt and activity"") in that it will perturb
the internal PRNG's statee using externally collected noise, except that
it will not pick that noise from the random pool's bits nor upon
interrupt, but will rather combine a few elements along the Tx path
that are collectively hard to predict, such as dev, skb and txq
pointers, packet length and jiffies values. These ones are combined
using a single round of SipHash into a single long variable that is
mixed with the net_rand_state upon each invocation.

The operation was inlined because it produces very small and efficient
code, typically 3 xor, 2 add and 2 rol. The performance was measured
to be the same (even very slightly better) than before the switch to
SipHash; on a 6-core 12-thread Core i7-8700k equipped with a 40G NIC
(i40e), the connection rate dropped from 556k/s to 555k/s while the
SYN cookie rate grew from 5.38 Mpps to 5.45 Mpps.

"lightnvm: pblk: do not overwrite ppa list with meta list

Ehen using pblk with 0 sized metadata both ppa list and meta list
points to the same memory since pblk_dma_meta_size() returns 0 in
that case.

This patch fix that issue by ensuring that pblk_dma_meta_size()
always returns space equal to sizeof(struct pblk_sec_meta) and thus
ppa list and meta list points to different memory address.

Even that in that case drive does not really care about meta_list
pointer, this is the easiest way to fix that issue without introducing
changes in many places in the code just for 0 sized metadata case.

The same approach needs to be also done for pblk_get_sec_meta()
since we also cannot point to the same memory address in meta buffer
when we are using it for pblk recovery process

"filter: AWS Lambda filter (initial version) (#10260)

This filter transform HTTP requests to AWS Lambda invocations.

The filter supports pass-through only. Meaning, the request body
is passed to Lambda as is. Note: Lambda requires the request to be in
JSON format.

In a later iteration, we'll wrap the headers the body in a JSON string
before passing it to Lambda.

The filter requires the ARN of the Lambda function and supports
per-filter-config. When the per-filter configuration is used, the target
cluster must be tagged with specific metadata. This indicates to the
filter whether to process the request or to skip it.

Lambda supports two invocation modes:
- Synchronous (Request-Response)
- Asynchronous (Event)

This initial version of the filter supports the synchronous mode only.
In a later iteration I'll add support for the asynchronous (Event-based)
version.

"[CPUFREQ] ondemand: fix tickless accounting and software coordination bug

With tickless kernel and software coordination os P-states, ondemand
can look at wrong idle statistics. This can happen when ondemand sampling
is happening on CPU 0 and due to software coordination sampling also looks at
utilization of CPU 1. If CPU 1 is in tickless state at that moment, its idle
statistics will not be uptodate and CPU 0 thinks CPU 1 is idle for less
amount of time than it actually is.

This can be resolved by looking at all the busy times of CPUs, which is
accurate, even with tickless, and use that to determine idle time in a
round about way (total time - busy time).

If the VMA is non-linear, fall back to syncing the entire file, but we

"kconfig: improve seed in randconfig

'make randconfig' uses glibc's rand function, and the seed of
that PRNG is set via:

			srand(time(NULL));

But 'time()' only increases once every second - freezing the
randconfig result within a single second.

My Nehalem testbox does randconfig much faster than 1 second
 and i have a few scripts that do 'randconfig until condition X'
loops.

Those scripts currently waste a lot of CPU time due to randconfig
changing its seed only once per second currently.

Change the seed to be micrseconds based. (I checked the statistical
spread of the seed - the now.tv_sec*now.tv_usec multiplication
there further improves it.)

"ACPI / sysfs: Update sysfs signature handling code

This patch cleans up sysfs table signature handling code:

 1. Convert the signature handling code to use the ACPICA APIs to
    benefit from the future improvements of the APIs.

 2. Add 'filename' attribute in order to handle both BE/LE name tags.

 3. Add instance check in order to avoid the possible buffer overflow
    related to the table file name.

"CIFS: Increment num_remote_opens stats counter even in case of smb2_query_dir_first

The num_remote_opens counter keeps track of the number of open files which must be
maintained by the server at any point. This is a per-tree-connect counter, and the value
of this counter gets displayed in the /proc/fs/cifs/Stats output as a following...

Open files: 0 total (local), 1 open on server
                             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As a thumb-rule, we want to increment this counter for each open/create that we
successfully execute on the server. Similarly, we should decrement the counter when
we successfully execute a close.

In this case, an increment was being missed in case of smb2_query_dir_first,
in case of successful open. As a result, we would underflow the counter and we
could even see the counter go to negative after sufficient smb2_query_dir_first calls.

I tested the stats counter for a bunch of filesystem operations with the fix.
And it looks like the counter looks correct to me.

I also check if we missed the increments and decrements elsewhere. It does not
seem so. Few other cases where an open is done and we don't increment the counter are
the compound calls where the corresponding close is also sent in the request.

"scsi: zfcp: drop duplicate fsf_command from zfcp_fsf_req which is also in QTCB header

Status read buffers (SRBs, unsolicited notifications) never use a QTCB
[zfcp_fsf_req_create()]. zfcp_fsf_req_send() already uses this to
distinguish SRBs from other FSF request types. We can re-use this method in
zfcp_fsf_req_complete(). Introduce a helper function to make the check for
req->qtcb less magic.

SRBs always are FSF_QTCB_UNSOLICITED_STATUS, so we can hard-code this for
the two trace functions dealing with SRBs.

All other FSF request types have a QTCB and we can get the fsf_command from
there.

zfcp_dbf_hba_fsf_response() and thus zfcp_dbf_hba_fsf_res() are only called
for non-SRB requests so it's safe to dereference the QTCB
[zfcp_fsf_req_complete() returns early on SRB, else calls
zfcp_fsf_protstatus_eval() which calls zfcp_dbf_hba_fsf_response()].  In
zfcp_scsi_forget_cmnd() we guard the QTCB dereference with a preceding NULL
check and rely on boolean shortcut evaluation.

As a side effect, this causes an alignment hole which we can close in
a later patch after having cleaned up all fields of struct zfcp_fsf_req.
Before:
$ pahole -C zfcp_fsf_req drivers/s390/scsi/zfcp.ko

"zfcp: fix ELS/GS request&response length for hardware data router

In the hardware data router case, introduced with kernel 3.2
commit 86a9668a8d29 (""[SCSI] zfcp: support for hardware data router"")
the ELS/GS request&response length needs to be initialized
as in the chained SBAL case.

Otherwise, the FCP channel rejects ELS requests with
FSF_REQUEST_SIZE_TOO_LARGE.

Such ELS requests can be issued by user space through BSG / HBA API,
or zfcp itself uses ADISC ELS for remote port link test on RSCN.
The latter can cause a short path outage due to
unnecessary remote target port recovery because the always
failing ADISC cannot detect extremely short path interruptions
beyond the local FCP channel.

This is because sound_spdif is waiting on its CPU DAI &spdif to probe,

Exposure of the SPDIF pin is board-specific functionality, so the sound
card and codec DAI belong in the individual board DTS, not the SoC DTSI.

Summary:
Was not thinking when I tried to precompute combination flags in py3.flags
enums.  This is pretty rediculous as 32bits of flag combinations is quite large

The cpu cost to decompose a flag combination is always O(n) where n < 32.
So instead of pre-computing, just decompose the value in real time.

We still cache them so that we will never have an enum instance with
the same values but different `id()` thus failing the `is` check

"Speed up refcount-opts

Summary: We were spending a lot of time copying the State struct, which had 4
smart::hash_maps in it. I converted two of the three sites to move instead of
copy and switched to smart::flat_map. flat_map is significantly faster to copy
and move, and isn't much slower to insert/look up at the relatively small sizes
these maps tend to be. The net effect is that optimizeRefcounts() is down to
~31% of time in optimize(), from ~35%. It's also no longer the most expensive
optimizatin - that title now belongs to reoptimize().

collectLdStacks has been dead since we removed the simplifier optimization that
replaced some of SpillStack/Call's sources with None so I removed it.

Summary: Instead of using out custom json pretty printing library, we'll now turn those same objects into javascript objects using js_of_ocaml's library functions.

Then, if we want json, we can use the native javascript's JSON.stringify to turn it into perfect json, instead of our hacky thing. (This'll be faster too.)

Also, this will let callers simply look inside the object instead of having it serialized and then deserialized for no reason (faster).

"runtime: do not scan maps when k/v do not contain pointers

Currently we scan maps even if k/v does not contain pointers.
This is required because overflow buckets are hanging off the main table.
This change introduces a separate array that contains pointers to all
overflow buckets and keeps them alive. Buckets themselves are marked
as containing no pointers and are not scanned by GC (if k/v does not
contain pointers).

This brings maps in line with slices and chans -- GC does not scan
their contents if elements do not contain pointers.

Currently scanning of a map[int]int with 2e8 entries (~8GB heap)
takes ~8 seconds. With this change scanning takes negligible time.

Update #9477.

We should never (currently) start a swipe from a non-begin-phase wheel event.
We already check this in handleScrollWheelEvent, but can still get
non-begin-phase events in wheelEventWasNotHandled.

We only start ""pending"" swipes with Begin events, so we should never make them
non-pending with anything but a Begin event (we'll get it when it bubbles back up,
unhandled, from WebCore). In addition, AppKit throws an exception when we try
to start a swipe from end-phase events.

"libbpf: fix libbpf_print

With the recent print rework we now have the following problem:
pr_{warning,info,debug} expand to __pr which calls libbpf_print.
libbpf_print does va_start and calls __libbpf_pr with va_list argument.
In __base_pr we again do va_start. Because the next argument is a
va_list, we don't get correct pointer to the argument (and print noting
in my case, I don't know why it doesn't crash tbh).

Fix this by changing libbpf_print_fn_t signature to accept va_list and
remove unneeded calls to va_start in the existing users.

Alternatively, this can we solved by exporting __libbpf_pr and
changing __pr macro to (and killing libbpf_print):
{
	if (__libbpf_pr)
		__libbpf_pr(level, ""libbpf: "" fmt, ##__VA_ARGS__)

"mei: me: use an index instead of a pointer for private data

Device 'new_id' interface is useful for testing of not yet published
hardware on older kernels and for internally used device ids on
simulation platforms.
However currently with the device configuration held in device_id driver
data as a pointer to mei_cfg structure it is hard, as one need to locate
the address of the correct structure.
A recommended way of doing that is to use and index instead of a
pointer.
This patch adds a new list of configuration mei_cfg_list[]
indexed via enum mei_cfg_idx.
In addition it cleanups ich platform naming, renames legacy
generation to ich and what was ich to ich10.

"kselftests: vm: add mremap tests

Patch series ""Speed up mremap on large regions"", v4.

mremap time can be optimized by moving entries at the PMD/PUD level if the
source and destination addresses are PMD/PUD-aligned and PMD/PUD-sized.
Enable moving at the PMD and PUD levels on arm64 and x86.  Other
architectures where this type of move is supported and known to be safe
can also opt-in to these optimizations by enabling HAVE_MOVE_PMD and
HAVE_MOVE_PUD.

Observed Performance Improvements for remapping a PUD-aligned 1GB-sized
region on x86 and arm64:

    - HAVE_MOVE_PMD is already enabled on x86 : N/A
    - Enabling HAVE_MOVE_PUD on x86   : ~13x speed up

    - Enabling HAVE_MOVE_PMD on arm64 : ~ 8x speed up
    - Enabling HAVE_MOVE_PUD on arm64 : ~19x speed up

          Altogether, HAVE_MOVE_PMD and HAVE_MOVE_PUD
          give a total of ~150x speed up on arm64.

This patch (of 4):

Test mremap on regions of various sizes and alignments and validate data
after remapping.  Also provide total time for remapping the region which
is useful for performance comparison of the mremap optimizations that move
pages at the PMD/PUD levels if HAVE_MOVE_PMD and/or HAVE_MOVE_PUD are
enabled.

"Fix provider cipher reinit issue

Fixes #12405
Fixes #12377

Calling Init()/Update() and then Init()/Update() again gave a different result when using the same key and iv.
Cipher modes that were using ctx->num were not resetting this value, this includes OFB, CFB & CTR.
The fix is to reset this value during the ciphers einit() and dinit() methods.
Most ciphers go thru a generic method so one line fixes most cases.

Add test for calling EVP_EncryptInit()/EVP_EncryptUpdate() multiple times for all ciphers.
Ciphers should return the same value for both updates.
DES3-WRAP does not since it uses a random in the update.
CCM modes currently also fail on the second update (This also happens in 1_1_1).

Fix memory leak in AES_OCB cipher if EVP_EncryptInit is called multiple times.

Fix AES_SIV cipher dup_ctx and init.
Calling EVP_CIPHER_init multiple times resulted in a memory leak in the siv.
Fixing this leak also showed that the dup ctx was not working for siv mode.
Note: aes_siv_cleanup() can not be used by aes_siv_dupctx() as it clears data
that is required for the decrypt (e.g the tag).

"VMware balloon: stop locking pages when hypervisor tells us enough

When hypervisor decides to decrease target balloon size while the balloon
driver tries to lock pages hypervisor may respond with
VMW_BALLOON_PPN_NOTNEEDED.  Use this data and immediately stop reserving
pages and wait for the next update cycle to fetch new target instead of
continuing trying to lock pages until size of refused list grows above
VMW_BALLOON_MAX_REFUSED (16) pages.

As a result the driver stops bothering the hypervisor with its attempts to
lock more pages that are not needed anymore.  Most likely next order from
hypervisor will be to reduce ballon size anyway.

It is a small optimization.

When vdev_psize increases, the location of labels 2 and 3 changes

device vulnerable to the beginning of the device being overwritten or

"ARM: pm: omap3: run the ASM sleep code from DDR

Most of the ASM sleep code (in arch/arm/mach-omap2/sleep34xx.S)
is copied to internal SRAM at boot and after wake-up from CORE OFF
mode.  However only a small part of the code really needs to run from
internal SRAM.

This fix lets most of the ASM idle code run from the DDR in order to
minimize the SRAM usage and the overhead in the code copy.

The only pieces of code that are mandatory in SRAM are:
- the i443 erratum WA,
- the i581 erratum WA,
- the security extension code.

SRAM usage:
- original code:
  . 560 bytes for omap3_sram_configure_core_dpll (used by DVFS),
  . 852 bytes for omap_sram_idle (used by suspend/resume in RETention),
  . 124 bytes for es3_sdrc_fix (used by suspend/resume in OFF mode on ES3.x),
  . 108 bytes for save_secure_ram_context (used on HS parts only).

With this fix the usage for suspend/resume in RETention goes down 288
bytes, so the gain in SRAM usage for suspend/resume is 564 bytes.

Also fixed the SRAM initialization sequence to avoid an unnecessary
copy to SRAM at boot time and for readability.

Tested on Beagleboard (ES2.x) in idle with full RET and OFF modes.

"netlink: change nlmsg_notify() return value logic

This patch changes the return value of nlmsg_notify() as follows:

If NETLINK_BROADCAST_ERROR is set by any of the listeners and
an error in the delivery happened, return the broadcast error;
else if there are no listeners apart from the socket that
requested a change with the echo flag, return the result of the
unicast notification. Thus, with this patch, the unicast
notification is handled in the same way of a broadcast listener
that has set the NETLINK_BROADCAST_ERROR socket flag.

This patch is useful in case that the caller of nlmsg_notify()
wants to know the result of the delivery of a netlink notification
(including the broadcast delivery) and take any action in case
that the delivery failed. For example, ctnetlink can drop packets
if the event delivery failed to provide reliable logging and
state-synchronization at the cost of dropping packets.

This patch also modifies the rtnetlink code to ignore the return
value of rtnl_notify() in all callers. The function rtnl_notify()
(before this patch) returned the error of the unicast notification
which makes rtnl_set_sk_err() reports errors to all listeners. This
is not of any help since the origin of the change (the socket that
requested the echoing) notices the ENOBUFS error if the notification
fails and should resync itself.

"Initialize timezone early

log_event() uses date(), which triggers a PHP notice when the default

Since core.php initializes the timezone only after including several

can prevent MantisBT from operating properly.

To prevent this problem, we now set the default timezone as early as we
can, and change it later if necessary according to the user's
preferences.

"net/ipv6: Save route type in rt6_info

The RTN_ type for IPv6 FIB entries is currently embedded in rt6i_flags

relied on for FIB dumps so save the route type as fib6_type.

fc_type is set in current users based on the algorithm in rt6_fill_node:
  - rt6i_flags contains RTF_LOCAL: fc_type = RTN_LOCAL
  - rt6i_flags contains RTF_ANYCAST: fc_type = RTN_ANYCAST
  - else fc_type = RTN_UNICAST

Similarly, fib6_type is set in the rt6_info templates based on the
RTF_REJECT section of rt6_fill_node converting dst.error to RTN type.

"sched/numa, mm: Use active_nodes nodemask to limit numa migrations

Use the active_nodes nodemask to make smarter decisions on NUMA migrations.

In order to maximize performance of workloads that do not fit in one NUMA
node, we want to satisfy the following criteria:

  1) keep private memory local to each thread

  2) avoid excessive NUMA migration of pages

  3) distribute shared memory across the active nodes, to
     maximize memory bandwidth available to the workload

This patch accomplishes that by implementing the following policy for
NUMA migrations:

  1) always migrate on a private fault

  2) never migrate to a node that is not in the set of active nodes
     for the numa_group

  3) always migrate from a node outside of the set of active nodes,
     to a node that is in that set

  4) within the set of active nodes in the numa_group, only migrate
     from a node with more NUMA page faults, to a node with fewer

"cgroup: Walk task list under tasklist_lock in cgroup_enable_task_cg_list

Walking through the tasklist in cgroup_enable_task_cg_list() inside
an RCU read side critical section is not enough because:

- RCU is not (yet) safe against while_each_thread()

- If we use only RCU, a forking task that has passed cgroup_post_fork()
  without seeing use_task_css_set_links == 1 is not guaranteed to have
  its child immediately visible in the tasklist if we walk through it
  remotely with RCU. In this case it will be missing in its css_set's
  task list.

Thus we need to traverse the list (unfortunately) under the
tasklist_lock. It makes us safe against while_each_thread() and also
make sure we see all forked task that have been added to the tasklist.

As a secondary effect, reading and writing use_task_css_set_links are
now well ordered against tasklist traversing and modification. The new
layout is:

CPU 0                                      CPU 1

use_task_css_set_links = 1                write_lock(tasklist_lock)
read_lock(tasklist_lock)                  add task to tasklist
do_each_thread() {                        write_unlock(tasklist_lock)
	add thread to css set links       if (use_task_css_set_links)
} while_each_thread()                         add thread to css set links
read_unlock(tasklist_lock)

If CPU 0 traverse the list after the task has been added to the tasklist
then it is correctly added to the css set links. OTOH if CPU 0 traverse
the tasklist before the new task had the opportunity to be added to the
tasklist because it was too early in the fork process, then CPU 1
catches up and add the task to the css set links after it added the task
to the tasklist. The right value of use_task_css_set_links is guaranteed
to be visible from CPU 1 due to the LOCK/UNLOCK implicit barrier properties:
the read_unlock on CPU 0 makes the write on use_task_css_set_links happening
and the write_lock on CPU 1 make the read of use_task_css_set_links that comes
afterward to return the correct value.

"tipc: Major redesign of broadcast link ACK/NACK algorithms

Completely redesigns broadcast link ACK and NACK mechanisms to prevent
spurious retransmit requests in dual LAN networks, and to prevent the
broadcast link from stalling due to the failure of a receiving node to
acknowledge receiving a broadcast message or request its retransmission.

Note: These changes only impact the timing of when ACK and NACK messages
are sent, and not the basic broadcast link protocol itself, so inter-
operability with nodes using the ""classic"" algorithms is maintained.

The revised algorithms are as follows:

1) An explicit ACK message is still sent after receiving 16 in-sequence
messages, and implicit ACK information continues to be carried in other
unicast link message headers (including link state messages).  However,
the timing of explicit ACKs is now based on the receiving node's absolute
network address rather than its relative network address to ensure that
the failure of another node does not delay the ACK beyond its 16 message
target.

2) A NACK message is now typically sent only when a message gap persists
for two consecutive incoming link state messages; this ensures that a
suspected gap is not confirmed until both LANs in a dual LAN network have
had an opportunity to deliver the message, thereby preventing spurious NACKs.
A NACK message can also be generated by the arrival of a single link state
message, if the deferred queue is so big that the current message gap
cannot be the result of ""normal"" mis-ordering due to the use of dual LANs
(or one LAN using a bonded interface). Since link state messages typically
arrive at different nodes at different times the problem of multiple nodes
issuing identical NACKs simultaneously is inherently avoided.

3) Nodes continue to ""peek"" at NACK messages sent by other nodes. If
another node requests retransmission of a message gap suspected (but not
yet confirmed) by the peeking node, the peeking node forgets about the
gap and does not generate a duplicate retransmit request. (If the peeking
node subsequently fails to receive the lost message, later link state
messages will cause it to rediscover and confirm the gap and send another
NACK.)

4) Message gap ""equality"" is now determined by the start of the gap only.
This is sufficient to deal with the most common cases of message loss,
and eliminates the need for complex end of gap computations.

5) A peeking node no longer tries to determine whether it should send a
complementary NACK, since the most common cases of message loss don't
require it to be sent. Consequently, the node no longer examines the
""broadcast tag"" field of a NACK message when peeking.

"Btrfs: change how we calculate the global block rsv

Traditionally we've calculated the global block rsv by guessing how much of the
metadata used amount was the extent tree, and then taking the data size and
figuring out how large the csum tree would have to be to hold that much data.

This is imprecise and falls down on MIXED file systems as we can't trust the
data used amount.  This resulted in failures for xfstests generic/333 because it
creates lots of clones, which explodes out the extent tree.  Our global reserve
calculations were woefully inaccurate in this case which meant we got into a
situation where we did not have enough reserved to do our work.

We know we only use the global block rsv for the extent, csum, and root trees,
so just get the bytes used for these trees and use that as the basis of our
global reserve.  Since these are not reference counted trees the bytes_used
value will be accurate.  This fixed the transaction aborts seen with
generic/333.  Thanks,

"sched: Ensure that a child can't gain time over it's parent after fork()

A fork/exec load is usually ""pass the baton"", so the child
should never be placed behind the parent.  With START_DEBIT we
make room for the new task, but with child_runs_first, that
room comes out of the _parent's_ hide. There's nothing to say
that the parent wasn't ahead of min_vruntime at fork() time,
which means that the ""baton carrier"", who is essentially the
parent in drag, can gain time and increase scheduling latencies
for waiters.

With NEW_FAIR_SLEEPERS + START_DEBIT + child_runs_first
enabled, we essentially pass the sleeper fairness off to the
child, which is fine, but if we don't base placement on the
parent's updated vruntime, we can end up compounding latency
woes if the child itself then does fork/exec.  The debit
incurred at fork doesn't hurt the parent who is then going to
sleep and maybe exit, but the child who acquires the error
harms all comers.

This improves latencies of make -j<n> kernel build workloads.

of random.h but for backporting, a smaller solution is preferred.

This one replaces linux/percpu.h with asm/percpu.h, and this fixes the
problem on x86_64, arm64, arm, and mips.  Note that moving percpu.h
around didn't change anything and that removing it entirely broke
differently.  When backporting, such options might still be considered
if this patch fails to help.

[ It turns out that an alternate fix seems to be to just remove the
  troublesome <asm/pointer_auth.h> remove from the arm64 <asm/smp.h>
  that causes the circular dependency.

  But we might as well do the whole belt-and-suspenders thing, and
  minimize inclusion in <linux/random.h> too. Either will fix the
  problem, and both are good changes.   - Linus ]

"x86/fpu: Improve the initialization logic of 'err' around xstate_fault() constraints

There's a confusing aspect of how xstate_fault() constraints are
handled by the FPU register/memory copying functions in
fpu/internal.h: they use ""0"" (0) to signal that the asm code
will not always set 'err' to a valid value.

But 'err' is already initialized to 0 in C code, which is duplicated
by the asm() constraint. Should the initialization value ever be
changed, it might become subtly inconsistent with the not too clear
asm() constraint.

Use 'err' as the value of the input variable instead, to clarify
this all.

"Core: Added support for button elements with descendants (#1901)

Non-Firefox browsers dispatch ""click"" on descendants of <button>, which breaks
the submitHandler logic that adds a hidden field with the name and value of the
submit button (since it is not included in the submission if it did not
initiate the submission, which might be the case when using form.submit in
submitHandler and returning false). submitButton is instead a descendant of
<button> and the hidden field does not compensate for the lack of an actual
submit button.

This would fix crbug.com/668524 and make submitButton an actual button.

In the case of `cPickle`, it is imported as `pickle` when python < 3 and
performance may be a consideration, but otherwise plain old `pickle` is
used.

Dealing with `StringIO` is a bit tricky. There is an `io.StringIO`
function in the `io` module, available since Python 2.6, but it expects
unicode whereas `StringIO.StringIO` expects ascii. The Python 3
equivalent is then `io.BytesIO`. What I have done here is used BytesIO
for anything that is emulating a file for testing purposes. That is more
explicit than using a redefined StringIO as was done before we dropped
support for Python 2.4 and 2.5.
